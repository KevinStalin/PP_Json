As states start lifting these mandates to reopen the economy, voluntary public compliance with public health recommendations may significantly influence the extent of resurgence in COVID-19 infection rates. Population-level risk from reopening may therefore be predicted from public intent to comply with public health recommendations. We are conducting a global, convergent design mixed-methods survey on public knowledge, perceptions, preferred health information sources, and understanding of and intent to comply with public health recommendations. With over 9,000 completed surveys from every US state and over 70 countries worldwide, to our knowledge this is the largest pandemic messaging study to date. Although the study is still ongoing, we have conducted an analysis of 5,005 US surveys completed from April 9-15, 2020 on public intent to comply with public health recommendations and offer insights on the COVID-19 pandemicrelated risk of reopening. We found marked regional differences in intent to follow key public health recommendations. Regional efforts are urgently needed to influence public behavior changes to decrease the risk of reopening, particularly in higher-risk areas with low public intent to comply with preventive health recommendations.

However, respondents reported a lower intent to comply with arguably the most important recommendation: avoid touching face. Washing hands, social distancing, staying home, and cough etiquette are important, but perfect compliance with them can be undone with a single careless touch. The lower the intent to comply with public health recommendations, the higher the likelihood of a resurgence of COVID-19 when mandatory quarantine ends.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Atlanta, GA, has the lowest intent to most certainly comply with the recommendation to avoid touching face (44%, p <. 05). At the same time, Atlanta has the greatest COVID-19 burden in Georgia, and managed to plateau their cases-per-week under lockdown (Georgia Department of Health, 2020), but still has high occupancy of intensive care facilities, limiting their ability to effectively manage a surge (Whyte, 2020) . Respondents from Minneapolis, MN, Philadelphia, PA, and Seattle, WA, reported 50% or lower intent to most certainly comply with this recommendation (p <. 05). Formal analysis of possible correlation between intended compliance and resurgence during reopening is ongoing, and a challenge of evaluating resurgence is the 14day lag in reporting. Anecdotally, however, low-compliance areas appear to be particularly hard-hit during reopening. For example, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms of Atlanta, the city with the lowest intended compliance of avoid touching face (44%), mandated mask-wearing by executive order July 8, 2020, stating, \"Atlanta is going to do it [mandate mask wearing] today because . . . COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on our city, specifically Black and Brown communities. . . \" (FOX5Atlanta, 2020). Philadelphia, with 50% intended compliance of avoid touching face, has paused some of its reopening plans due to the rising number of positive COVID-19 cases, (McCormick & Brooks, 2020) and Washington, DC, with 52% intended compliance, has noted a \"troubling spike\" in coronavirus deaths over the past two weeks-even though not all deaths have been reported (NBC Washington Staff, 2020) .

This likely stems from our snowball sampling method. This group is associated with better health outcomes (Lago et al., 2018) , so our data may reflect the upper boundary of intent, in turn suggesting that other demographic groups may have lower compliance, and hence, higher risk. Recent data on selfreported compliance with public health recommendations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in African Americans supports this interpretation (Block, Berg, Lennon, Miller, & Nunez-Smith, 2020) . As an online, cross-sectional survey, we could not verify respondent veracity or describe true prevalence. The survey answers reflect a single moment in time and may not be generalizable over time. Our data were collected as stay-at-home orders started; hence, we collected self-reported intent to comply, which may reflect social desirability bias; in other words, our reported com-pliance may be what the public aspired to in April but does not actually practice today. Evolving social phenomenafrom a relaxing of attitudes over time, to nice weather enticing people outside, to civil disobedience and social action in the wake of prominent racially biased events-may all serve to further drive actual compliance today lower than the intended compliance we report, and may further cause differences across demographic groups.
