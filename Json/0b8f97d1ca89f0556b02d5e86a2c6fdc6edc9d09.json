National survey (2010-12) statistics have shown that, 35.5% of the Chinese aged 6 years and older have eaten out in the past week. The proportion of people dining out was 42.2% and 28.5% in urban and rural areas respectively. 4 Restaurants are becoming the second major dining location in China, and this has important impacts on public health and nutrition.",

International experience had proved that reducing population salt intake lowered blood pressure and reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 5 6 Salt reduction is considered one of the most cost-effective measures to improve public health. 7 In China, the average salt intake was 12-14g salt per day, which was more than double the WHOrecommended maximum level of 5g salt per day for adults. 8 9 With the rapid urbanization and lifestyle changes in China, eating in restaurants has been becoming popular, especially in urban areas. National survey (2010-12) statistics showed that, 35.5% of the Chinese aged 6 years and older had eaten out in the past week. The proportion of people dining out was 42.2% and 28.5% in urban and rural areas respectively. 4 Restaurants became the second major dining location after home-cooking in China, and this had important impacts on public health and nutrition. A pilot study using a one-week salt estimation method in Beijing found that approximately 40% of the salt intake was consumed outside the home. 10 Restaurant dishes seemed to have a high sodium content in both developed and developing countries. [11] [12] [13] [14] A study showed that 46.8% of the dishes served in Chinese restaurants in Beijing contained more salt than the daily salt intake recommended by WHO. 14 Sodium content was substantially higher in restaurant foods than in home-made foods. [15] [16] [17] Therefore, to help consumers reduce their overall salt intake, it is important to develop an effective strategy to reduce the sodium content of restaurant foods.

International experience had proved that reducing population salt intake lowered blood pressure and reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). 5 6 Salt reduction is considered one of the most cost-effective measures to improve public health. 7 In China, the average salt intake was 12-14g salt per day, which was more than double the WHOrecommended maximum level of 5g salt per day for adults. 8 9 With the rapid urbanization and lifestyle changes in China, eating in restaurants has been becoming popular, especially in urban areas. National survey (2010-12) statistics showed that, 35.5% of the Chinese aged 6 years and older had eaten out in the past week.

Few studies existed on the sodium content of restaurant dishes in China. 14 25 The current study covered a wide range of restaurants in 6 provinces, could provide the evidence on the sodium level and sources in Chinese restaurants, which will be very helpful to develop the specific intervention measures. The study aimed to explore a feasible, effective and sustainable approach to achieve salt reduction for Chinese restaurants. With an increasing proportion of people eating out, restaurant dishes contributed much more sodium than decades before and induced more health risks. Compared with salt reduction initiatives in individuals, communities or schools, those conducted in restaurants may face more challenges. With this study, we will identify barriers and facilitators for implementation, as well as solutions suitable to Chinese restaurants to reduce salt. Based on these findings, we will be able to draw important public health implications.",

Local county investigators were responsible to enhance the knowledge and skills among staff in each intervention restaurant by conducting monthly follow-up supervisions.During the trial, each intervention restaurant was encouraged to reduce salt usage by 10% in all dishes, and greater reductions according to the customers' request (such as, -30% or -50% salt).Furthermore, at least 3 lower-salt dishes (sodium\u2264100mg/100g) per restaurant should be developed through reformulation to provide customers more options of lower-salt dishes.

In each province, 2 counties of similar socioeconomic level in the provincial capital city were selected.The counties that had participated in other salt-reduction projects were excluded to minimize contamination. To determine the effectiveness of the salt reduction package in restaurants of different sizes, of the 16 Chinese restaurants selected from each county, it was ensured these included 4 large restaurants, 8 medium restaurants and 4 small restaurants. The restaurants in each county were then randomly allocated to the intervention or control group after the baseline survey, using the random procedure on electronic data recording platform (EDC).
