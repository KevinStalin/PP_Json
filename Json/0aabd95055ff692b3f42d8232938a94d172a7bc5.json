Singapore was one of the first countries outside of China to be affected and reported its first case in January 2020. Strategies that were deployed successfully during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome have had to evolve to contain this novel coronavirus. Like the rest of the health care services in Singapore, the practice of ophthalmology has also had to adapt to this rapidly changing crisis. This article discusses the measures put in place by the 3 largest ophthalmology centers in Singapore's public sector in response to COVID-19, and the challenges of providing eye care in the face of stringent infection control directives, staff redeployments and \"social distancing.\" The recently imposed \"circuit breaker,\" effectively a partial lockdown of the country, has further limited our work to only the most essential of services. Our staff are also increasingly part of frontline efforts in the screening and care of patients with COVID-19. However, this crisis has also been an opportunity to push ahead with innovative practices and given momentum to the use of teleophthalmology and other digital technologies. Amidst this uncertainty, our centers are already planning for how ophthalmology in Singapore will be practiced in this next stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond.",

SARS was a grim milestone for the healthcare system in Singapore, infecting 238 patients (many of them health care workers) and resulting in 33 deaths. 3 The first case of COVID-19 was diagnosed in Singapore on January 23, in a Chinese tourist from Wuhan, 4,5 prompting a range of public health measures. As more infections were identified within the community, Singapore raised the Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level 8 from Yellow to Orange on February 7, 2020, and further public health, social, economic, and immigration measures were imposed. Two more waves of COVID-19 infection occurred in March and April, initially comprising infections imported by Singapore residents returning from Europe and the United States, and subsequently by an escalating number of infections among our migrant worker population. On April 7, Singapore declared a partial lock-down of the country, enforcing strict social distancing initiatives and allowing only essential services to continue. This so-called \"circuit breaker\" will be in place until June 1, 2020. 6 Our health care systems' experience with SARS shaped the initial response to this pandemic, but as events unfolded, it became evident that new measures would have to be developed to contain the spread of This article summarizes the evolving experiences of the 3 public sector eye centers in Singapore, and the challenges of practicing ophthalmology in the midst of this rapidly evolving healthcare crisis.",

Because of the SARS experience, the Singapore government maintains a stockpile of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) which is primarily reserved for health care workers. In January, all patient-facing staff had to review their N95 mask fit and revise the protocols for donning and doffing PPE. Even with the stockpile, guidelines for the use of PPE were disseminated 9 and updated by MOH, to ensure appropriate usage while at the same time managing this finite resource. In the ophthalmology setting, a surgical mask, coupled with strict hand hygiene, was considered adequate for routine clinical and surgical activities. 10 The proper use of surgical masks, along with other universal precautions, has been reported to mitigate the risks of transmission even in the event of inadvertent exposure. 11 For specific situations, such as examination of COVID-19 positive patients or in high risk settings (eg, during any aerosol-generating procedures 12, 13 in operating theaters, such as dacryocystorhinostomy, or intubation for general anesthesia), \"full PPE\" (including an N95 mask, goggles, and disposable gown and gloves) was mandated.",

Although nursing and allied health staff were typically stationed only at one location throughout the work week, most doctors routinely moved between different institutions in the same cluster, often within the same day. With campus separation, the first order of business was to identify the ophthalmologists that would be specifically stationed at the different hospitals and satellites, to provide adequate coverage and to a level of subspecialty care that is appropriate for that satellite. For example, SNEC provides vitreoretinal, glaucoma, and oculoplastics services at the Changi General Hospital (CGH), and so an appropriate number of vitreoretinal, glaucoma, and oculoplastics specialists were required to provide continuity of care. Junior staff, including residents and fellows, were similarly sent to cover other essential services in CGH, such as on-call and emergency department coverage. Nursing and allied health numbers were also buffered at the satellites, as staff from other sites could no longer be re-deployed at short notice to cover medical leave and other absences from work.",

There was a need for medical staff to bolster the fever screening area of the NCID to match the patient load, and ophthalmologists from the NHG Eye Institute stepped up to the task. 14 At any one point, 20% to 30% of the ophthalmology staff (ranging from residents to the senior faculty) were rostered to spend 10 days at NCID to screen and swab test patients suspected of COVID-19 infections.

This occurred in one of the centers, where a patient was diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection 2 days after attending a scheduled eye consultation in the outpatient clinic. Contact tracing revealed that the patient had come into close contact with 5 members of the clinic staff. Although the patient was reportedly asymptomatic during the initial visit and staff were considered at low risk of infection, all five staff members were nonetheless given a 14-day leave of absence to self-quarantine at home. Three of the 5 staff did indeed develop some symptoms of an ARI during this period, but none were found to have a COVID-19 infection. Although it was fortunate that none of the staff were infected, this incident did result in a sudden disruption to the clinic's manpower and staffing, and generated a great deal of anxiety among the affected staff and colleagues.",

Senior doctors had to review electronic medical records (EMR) to decide which patients could be deferred to a later date, or even discharged completely if institutional guidelines were fulfilled. Text messages were sent to these patients, along with details on how to reschedule visits and obtain top-up prescriptions. Appointments could be made online or through a smartphone application.

As this was before Singapore instituted mandatory quarantine of all returning residents from overseas, the ophthalmologist returned to work briefly to review 4 patients but was mindful to wear a surgical mask and avoided social interaction with staff. The following day, the ophthalmologist developed symptoms of an ARI, and promptly reported to the staff clinic for a swab test. The infection was confirmed that same day and the consultant was subsequently hospitalized. Assessment by the cluster's infection control team was that the risk to the patients and staff was low, and none had to be isolated or quarantined. Five staff members who had some contact with the ophthalmologist were allowed to continue to work, but were instructed to wear a surgical mask at all times, and to monitor their temperature twice daily. Fortunately, there was no transmission of the infection to patient and staff, and the ophthalmologist has since recovered and returned to work.",
