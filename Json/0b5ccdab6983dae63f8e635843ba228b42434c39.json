The viral load in the faeces of COVID-19 patients was estimated between 10 3 and 10 7 copies/mL, depending on the infection course (reviewed in Foladori et al., 2020 ). These patients have been shown to shed the virus in their stools even if asymptomatic or presymptomatic Park et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020) . Sewage samples can thus be used to monitor the levels of virus circulating in the population, an approach called wastewaterbased epidemiology (WBE). Several studies performed in the Netherlands (Medema et al., 2020) , the United States (Wu et al., 2020; Nemudryi et al., 2020; Sherchan et al., 2020) , France (Wurtzer (La Rosa et al, 2020) . Sample concentration was performed using the two-phase (PEG-dextran) separation method recommended by the WHO Guidelines for environmental surveillance of poliovirus circulation (WHO, 2003) , with modifications. Briefly, 250 mL of wastewater sample was centrifuged (30 min at 1200 \u00d7 g) to separate the pellet. The pellet was kept at 4 \u00b0C to be later combined with the concentrated supernatant. The clarified wastewater was neutralized (pH 7.0-7.5), mixed with dextran and polyethylene glycol (19.8 ml of 22% dextran, 143.5 ml 29% PEG 6000, and 17.5 ml 5N NaCl), and after a constant agitation for 30 minutes using a horizontal shaker, the mixture was left to stand overnight at 4 \u00b0C in a separation funnel. Viruses, accumulated in the smaller bottom layer and/or at the boundary between the layers (interphase), were then collected drop-wise, and this concentrate was re-joined to the pellet retained after the initial centrifugation. In a previous study by our group on SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage (La Rosa et al., 2020) , the original WHO protocol was modified by omitting the chloroform treatment after collecting the concentrate, to avoid loss of SARS-CoV-2 particles, since lipid-containing viruses are chloroform sensitive. However, this resulted in PCR inhibition (median 29.1%; range 8.7% -51.4%). Therefore, after performing comparative extraction experiments with and without chloroform, using samples spiked with the human Alphacoronavirus HCoV 229E and field samples (see Supplementary Material), the chloroform purification step was reintroduced to improve the purification of samples before RNA extraction, and obtain a higher detection sensitivity.

The recovery efficiency of the concentration and extraction procedure, evaluated with seeded experiments performed in quadruplicate, using the Alphacoronavirus HCoV-229E (ATCC VR-740) showed an average recovery of 2.04 \u00b1 0.70%. Sample inhibition, assessed by real-time RT-(q)PCR, ranged from null to 49.0%, with a median value of 3.2%. With regard to the 40 sewage samples collected between October 2019 and February 2020 from the WWTPs in Milan, Turin and Bologna, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by nested RT-PCR in 18/40 (45%) samples (amplicon sequences confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 by blast analysis) and in 26/40 (65%) samples by the newly developed real-time RT-(q)PCR (Table 2), with an overall agreement between the two assays of 65.0% (26/40 paired results). In 15 samples, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by both methods. Only these samples, that tested positive by both nested and real-time PCR, were considered as confirmed positive samples. None of the samples tested positive using the previously published SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and Sarbeco E gene protocols. Of the 15 positive samples, 8 were taken earlier than February 21, i.e. before the first autochthonous Italian case was reported. Specifically, the first SARS-CoV-2 positive sewage samples were collected as early as 18 December 2019 in Milan and Turin and 29 January 2020 in Bologna. In all three cities, the virus was also detected in the samples collected in January and February, with only one exception -the February sample from Bologna. Here, however, the negative real-time RT-(q)PCR result may have been affected by the slightly higher-than-usual inhibition in this amplification (16.3%). Virus concentration in the samples(Table 2 andFigure 2) ranged from <LOD to 5.6 \u00d7 10 4 g.c./L, and most of the positive samples (23/26) were below the analytical LOQ (5.9 \u00d7 10 3 g.c./L).

As far as we know, COVID-19 first affected Lombardy and Veneto and, later on, all the other regions of Italy. The vast majority of cases were reported in Northern Italy. Phylogenetic analyses on SARS-CoV-2 sequences conducted at the beginning of the epidemic, cluster Italian sequences far from the first two Chinese tourists' strains, and suggest that there may have been multiple introductions of the virus into Italy(Bartolini et al., 2020;Stefanelli et al., 2020), followed by autochthonous transmission. A genomic characterisation and phylogenetic analysis performed on complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from patients involved in the first outbreak of COVID-19 in Lombardy, suggested that SARS-CoV-2 entered Northern Italy weeks before the first reported case of infection(Zehender et al., 2020).To test this hypothesis, we analysed sewage samples collected between October 2019 and February 2020 in Northern Italy in the framework of projects on enteric viruses and stored in the archive of the Department of Environment and Health at the Italian National Institute of Health. In a previous J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f study, we demonstrated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in untreated wastewaters in Italy by analysing samples collected during the early stages of the epidemic (February to April 2020)(La Rosa et al.,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "documented autochthonous case, reported on February 21, 2020. Specifically, viral RNA first occurred in sewage samples collected on December 18th, in Milan (Lombardy) and Turin (Piedmont). Therefore, after mid-December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 had already been circulating in major urban centres surrounding the area (Codogno, in the province of Lodi) where the first case of COVID-19 was reported in February 2020. Significantly, all of these regions documented COVID-19 cases starting from 25th February (Protezione Civile, 2020).Other findings supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 had been circulating in Italy, as well as in other countries, as early as the end of 2019. Indeed, the fact that the virus had been circulating in Europe in late December 2019 has already been demonstrated by a French study(Deslandes et al., 2020) that retrospectively analysed samples taken from intensive care patients with influenza-like symptoms in Paris, and found one SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory sample in a French resident who had not visited China and who had been hospitalised on December 27, 2020.

Indeed, sewage is a very complex matrix, and assays developed for clinical samples are not always suitable for use on environmental samples. The newly designed assay was shown to be specific for SARS-CoV-2 by testing against the human coronavirus panel, nucleic acids from relevant viruses and bacteria and 'blank' samples. While cross-reactivity with untested J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f microorganisms or with uncharacterised viruses displaying sequences closely matching the target region may not be excluded in principle, the absence of any amplification in 'blank' samples supported the specificity of the reaction. Further tests on a larger variety of reference strains and complex matrices, however, should be performed for full validation of this method. The sensitivity of the assay was also assessed, and proved to be fit for use. On the other hand, none of the samples tested positive using the previously published SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and Sarbeco E gene protocols(Corman et al., 2020) recommended for the screening clinical sample. There is still no consensus on the use of an assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in environmental samples, and comparative studies with primers targeting different genome regions should be performed to assess the sensitivity and specificity of the different methods in environmental matrices.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF5": {"text": "Figure 1.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF6": {"text": "J", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "TABREF0": {"text": "Italy is one of the first and most severely affected countries in Europe, with a high number of documented cases and deaths.
