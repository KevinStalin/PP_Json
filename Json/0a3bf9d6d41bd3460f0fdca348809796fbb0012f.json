An additional 200 Mohs sections were used for model finetuning. The final test set consisted of 100 frozen sections from 50 patients. 36 sections had BCC, 64 were benign. The model used was a ResNet34 convolutional neural network (CNN) pre-trained on natural images. We compared the algorithm's performance to that of three Mohs surgeons reading individually the same 100 WSI on a screen. Our algorithm performed with high sensitivity (Figure 1). It identified correctly all sections with BCC. There were 4 false-positive results (specificity of 94%). The specificity of the surgeons ranged from 91.4% to 100%. Two of three surgeons achieved a specificity of 100% (all margins scored as positive contained BCC). The sensitivity of the surgeons in detecting BCC on the algorithm to the surgeons one needs to bear in mind that our test conditions don't mirror clinical practice. Scanned images, not slides were used. Furthermore, when a microscopic finding of uncertain significance is encountered in clinical practice, one is not limited to rendering a best guess based on one slide alone. Additional histologic sections can be obtained for further clues. Nonetheless, assistance from a second reader, during Mohs surgery, such as an AI algorithm, could have clinical value. A discordance between the algorithm and a physician could prompt a second look at a particular slide in real time to ensure that no positive margin is missed. While our findings document clinical grade high sensitivity of our deep learning algorithm, a major limitation of the current study is the binary classification of BCC present versus absent. Further studies are needed to assess how the algorithm performs for the detection of other tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma. It is possible that different models may be required for various diagnostic problems. Prospective studies are needed to assess the practicality of integrating AI in clinical practice and how it affects outcomes.",
