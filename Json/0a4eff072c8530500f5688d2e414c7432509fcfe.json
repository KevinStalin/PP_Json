To date, a causal model of children's vicarious traumatization has not been empirically validated in the literature. This paper fills the gap in the literature by reporting on the direct effect of vicarious trauma on children independent of caregiving impairment. Data for the study came from the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence I (NATSCEV I). This unique dataset features two indicators of vicarious trauma exposure: (1) family victimization and (2) community violence. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted in order to control for nuisance variables such as caregiver impairment, defined as the degree of warmth or hostility; time elapsed since the trauma occurred and the study taking place; and other trauma exposure (i.e. direct and witnessed trauma). As expected, the study found evidence of a direct and positive relationship between learning about the trauma of close friends and family and children's trauma symptomatology. Both adolescents and young children were found to be vulnerable to experience vicarious traumatization, with gender and ethnicity being contributing factors. Chronological age was not found to be significant in children's vicarious traumatization. These findings support the causal model of vicarious traumatization. They demonstrate that children may be traumatized by exposure to the trauma material of others above and beyond the influence of caregiver impairment. As such, attention should be given to interventions, practices, and policies that intervene in the lives of children exposed to violence.",

It is believed that exposure to the pain and suffering of others causes traumatization in adults. In contrast, the leading child model of vicarious traumatization implicates caregiver impairment in children's pathology (Scheeringa and Zeanah 2001) . Scheeringa and Zeanah (2001) assert that parent and child posttraumatic symptomatology may be associated by \"a combination of moderating and vicarious traumatization effects\" (p. 809). In this model, both the caregiver and the child are traumatized, and the symptomatology in one exacerbates that in the other. The caregiver's trauma response prevents them from responding sensitively to their child's needs, resulting in further psychological injury to the child. As such, vicarious trauma is thought to have a compounding effect on children's reactions to a primary trauma.",

This observation resulted in the inclusion of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Brewin et al. 2009; Jones and Cureton 2014) .

The diagnostic criteria entailed the presence of at least six of seventeen symptoms accompanied by a subjective response of intense fear, helplessness, or horror (APA, 2000) . The subjective response criterion was later removed in recognition of the fact that trauma reactions may not accompany fear, helplessness, or horror (APA, 2013). The DSM IV also expanded the scope of the trauma exposure criterion to include that which is not personally or directly experienced (Brewin et al. 2009 ). The language indicated that \"events experienced by others that are learned about\" may produce PTSD (APA, 2000, p. 464) . The latest revision of the text further expanded on the construct of trauma by adding \"experiencing repeated or extreme exposure to aversive details of the traumatic event\" as possible subsets of trauma exposure (APA, 2013, p. 271 ). This version also added a preschool subtype of PTSD, which modified the exposure criterion and limited it to traumatic events that occurred to a parent and are indirectly learned about (APA, 2013) .",

McCann and Pearlman (1990) posited that vicarious traumatization goes beyond compassion fatigue, resulting in cognitive changes in the therapist's worldview similar to that observed in primary trauma victims. In recent years, the concept of vicarious trauma has been expanded to and studied among trauma workers across a wide spectrum to include social workers, fire fighters, police officers, and judges (Figley 2012) , as well as laypersons exposed to the trauma material of family and friends (Feldman and Kaal 2007; Scheeringa and Zeanah 2001; Smith et al. 2014; Weinberg 2011) .",

            "text": "A review of the literature on the effect of vicarious trauma exposure on children's mental health found that most studies rely on a moderation model similar to that put forward by Scheeringa and Zeanah (2001) . These studies implicate caregivers in children's vicarious trauma symptomatology. As a result, there is a dearth of research on the direct effect of vicarious trauma exposure on children. A review of the literature only found three prior sources examining or reporting on children's vicarious traumatization independent of caregiver impairment (DeVoe and Smith 2002; Terr 1990; Thornton 2014) . Terr (1990) described four cases from the field in which children presented with significant trauma symptoms in response to the trauma of others. As one example, Terr reported on Timothy Donnario, a five-year-old boy who was referred to therapy following the tragic kidnapping of his peers. After learning that he had narrowly escaped the fate of his peers who were kidnapped moments after they exited the school bus they had been riding together, Timothy began demonstrating symptoms of avoidance and anxiety consistent with trauma exposure. Another case is that of two-year-old Winifred, who was not present at the time of her sister's tragic death but, following repeated exposure to the details by family members who witnessed the trauma firsthand, began experiencing vivid memories and spontaneously recreating the traumatic event (Terr 1990 ). These cases, as well as two others reported by Terr, provide compelling evidence that children may have traumatic reactions to the trauma material of others.",

            "text": "In the area of empirical research, DeVoe and Smith (2002) convened focus groups to examine the impact of domestic violence on urban preschool children from the perspectives of their mothers. From five focus groups, the researchers found evidence that the women's children were not only acutely aware of the violence in their home, but also deeply impacted by it. They described the violence as an omnipresent tension in the home. The women also suggested that, when their children did not witness the violence, they filled in the gaps using their imagination, resulting in exaggerated fears. This study provided moving testimony that children encounter violence in the home as a trauma, whether or not they witness the abuse. Thornton (2014) added to the literature a qualitative study of eight children aged four to nine living in homes with domestic violence. Using projective play and drawing assessments to examine the emotional worlds of study participants, the researcher observed that violence in the children's homes was ever-present. Distressing material that the children confronted on a regular basis included injuries to the victim, the intense affect of the victim, physical damage to property, and disruptions in relationships and family dynamic. The researchers concluded that violence that is indirectly learned about is a traumatic stressor that lingers in the home and affects children's functioning over time.",

            "text": "Based on the literature on children's exposure to violence and trauma, this researcher developed a causal model of children's vicarious traumatization. See Fig. 1 for a visual representation of the causal model of children's vicarious traumatization. Similar to the adult model, it posits that children are vulnerable to experience vicarious traumatization by virtue of their ability to empathize with others (Figley 2002) . According to Hoffman's (2001) theory of empathy development, empathy is an inborn tendency that may be apparent as early as a few hours following birth and maturates through adulthood following a three-step process: 1) egocentric empathetic distress, 2) quasi-egocentric empathetic distress, and 3) veridical empathetic distress. Hoffman indicated that children toward the end of their first year of life may display egocentric empathetic distress in response to the distress of others (e.g. crying). These toddlers may not be able to distinguish between their self and others and may demonstrate personal distress in response to that of others. As toddlers mature, they become increasingly aware of the causes and consequences of emotions as well as the relationship between feelings and facial expressions. As such, they are able to make inferences regarding the distress of others based on a range of cues (e.g. crying, facial expressions, affect, injuries, words, context) and to internalize these messages as evidence of personal distress (Hoffman 2001) . Children as young as one year old have been reported in the literature as demonstrating empathetic responses to the distress of caregivers, strange children (Geangu et al. 2010; Hoffman 2001; Roth-Hanania et al. 2011; Zahn-Waxler et al. 1977) , and siblings (Dunn and Kendrick 1982) .",

Due to limitations in the data collection procedures of the primary study, this study was not able to test the full model. This study explored the following three research questions: This study was undergirded by constructivist theory (McCann and Pearlman 1990; Pearlman and Mac Ian 1995) and Hoffman's (2001) theory of empathy. Constructivist theory holds that one's worldview is created by interactions with the social environment, as mediated by one's cognitive schemas (Deering 2000; Kondrat 2002; McCann and Pearlman 1990; Michalopoulos and Aparicio 2012) . From this perspective, vicarious traumatization occurs through a process of empathetic engagement with the trauma material and sequelae of others that is incongruent with one's pre-existing cognitive schemas, resulting in maladaptive changes in cognitions (Michalopoulos and Aparicio 2012 ). Hoffman's (2001) theory of empathy development informs this study that empathy is an inborn tendency that matures over time. Thus, all children are vulnerable to experience vicarious traumatization but, the impact may be graded by the child's age.",

Because minorities are underrepresented in the general population, oversampling was utilized to increase the representation of African American, Hispanic, and lowincome households. The oversample group was also sampled through random-digit dialing. The final sample population consisted of 4549 children between the ages of zero and seventeen years old with 70% or greater African American, Hispanic, or low-income households. The cooperation rate for the nationally representative group was 71%, with a response rate of 54%. The oversample group indicated slightly less cooperation at 63%, with a response rate of 43%. Researchers conducted nonresponse analysis and found that the risk of victimization for those that opted out or were unavailable did not differ systematically from those that participated (Finkelhor et al. 2009b ).

This study featured two indicators of vicarious trauma, the violent victimization of close friends and family (vicarious family trauma) and community violence (vicarious community trauma). Researchers used an enhanced version of the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire to operationalize exposure to trauma and PTSD symptomatology (Finkelhor et al. 2009b) . Nine items asked respondents to indicate if the child heard about the victimization of others. Responses for these items were yes, no, not sure, or refused. In addition to the individual totals, a composite variable was calculated for vicarious trauma exposure to community violence and another for vicarious trauma exposure to family violence. This measure was shown to have strong construct validity for PTSD symptomatology and adequate test-retest reliability. The primary researchers conducted a small assessment of test-retest reliability and found agreement among the two administrations for 95% of the screener endorsements with a range for items from 79 to 100% (Finkelhor et al. 2005) . A test of Cronbach's Alpha also demonstrated that the measure had strong coherence in assessing victimization with a value for total victimization of 0.93 (Finkelhor et al. 2005) . In addition to the individual totals, a composite variable was calculated for vicarious trauma exposure to community violence and another for vicarious trauma exposure to family violence.",

This tool used a four-point Likert scale consisting of \"not at all, sometimes, often, and very often\" and asked respondents whether they had experienced the identified symptoms within the last month. Nonresponses of not sure and refused were also included. Twenty-five questions related to trauma symptoms for young children and 28 for adolescents.

The validity of this tool for trauma symptoms has been supported by moderate correlations as assessed by Cronbach's Alpha. The Cronbach value for total distress score was 0.93 (Finkelhor et al. 2005) . This study sought to evaluate the direct effect of vicarious trauma on children independent of caregiver impairment or other trauma exposure and time elapsed. For control variables, this study used perceived parental warmth or hostility towards their children, which were continuous data assessed by Likert scales. They were thought to capture caregiver impairment. Questions asked respondents to report on how often they engaged in behaviors reflective of these qualities. This study also held time elapsed since the trauma occurred and direct and witnessed trauma constant. Time elapsed (in years) since the trauma occurred were new control variables created for the purpose of this study by subtracting the participant's age at the time that the trauma occurred from the child's age at the time of the primary study. Direct trauma was conceptualized as any physical or sexual assaults that occurred to the child. Witnessed trauma was any violent victimization that occurred to others that were observed firsthand by the child. Both witnessed and direct trauma were treated as binary questions (i.e. yes or no).",

The researcher used hierarchical regression procedures to control for factors other than vicarious trauma that impact trauma symptoms (i.e. caregiver impairment and other trauma exposure; Lewis et al. 2013; Petrocelli 2003) . The forced method of data entry was also used to allow for theory testing (Petrocelli 2003) . Given that the data followed a random order (Finkelhor and Turner 2008) , missing data was handled using the means imputation method to retain statistical power (Raaijmakers 1999; Schafer and Graham 2002; Schlomer et al. 2010 ). Because children under the age of 10 were asked different questions regarding trauma symptoms and exposure than adolescents, separate but similar models were developed for young children and adolescents. The researcher sought to examine the differences in regression coefficients that each model yielded in order to draw inferences regarding how age impacted the strength of the relationship between vicarious trauma exposure and trauma symptomatology.",

The regression models entailed four steps based on their theoretical position and following causal priority (Petrocelli 2003) : (1) In the first block, best practices in mental health research dictate that demographic variables (gender, age, ethnicity, and SES) be entered into the equation (Petrocelli 2003) . The time elapsed variables were also forced into the equation at the first step. In the second step, known predictors of trauma symptoms from extant research (i.e. direct and witnessed trauma) were entered as control variables. Because this study was interested in understanding the direct effect of vicarious trauma on children independent of caregiver impairment, caregiver warmth and hostility were entered as controls in the third step. In the fourth and final step, the researcher entered vicarious family and community violence into the equation.",

Girls were observed to have higher rates of community violence exposure (Horowitz et al. 1995; Rojas-Gaona et al. 2016 ). Black youth also had the highest levels of vicarious community trauma exposure compared to all other ethnic groups (Roberts et al. 2011; Turner and Lloyd 2003) .

Thus, while extant studies indicate that proximity to the trauma is an important factor in children's development of trauma symptoms, this study demonstrates that vicarious trauma exposure is also a significant factor in children's trauma symptoms (Lewandowski et al. 2004; Scheeringa et al. 2013) .

Contrary to the importance of the family unit in child outcomes, vicarious community trauma was found to be a stronger predictor of trauma symptomatology than was family vicarious trauma exposure (Pat-Horenczyk et al. 2009 ). However, these differences were likely influenced by the fact that significantly more children reported vicarious community trauma exposure than vicarious family trauma exposure. Notably, among both young children and adolescents, being White emerged as a stronger predictor of trauma symptomatology than did other ethnicity groups. Given that White youth reported the lowest rates of trauma exposure than other youth and weights were used to control for differences in sample sizes, this finding is surprising. Though, it does support past research, which suggests that exposure to traumatic events produces greater changes in cognitive schemas among White populations than among cultural groups with a history of oppression (Hall-Clark et al. 2017; Williams et al. 2014) . This research points to higher baseline expectations about safety and control in White populations as compared to African Americans and other historically marginalized communities. In line with this theory, this study observed Black children and adolescents to have the highest rates of exposure to vicarious trauma but greater resilience against trauma symptoms than White children.",

It also found that children's trauma symptoms are a function of vicarious trauma exposure. This means that children are vulnerable to experience vicarious traumatization from the exposure of family and community victimization. The implication is that children should be assessed and extended clinical services when a family or friend experiences a traumatic event. In the case of vicarious trauma that occurs in the context of the family, family-focused interventions may be warranted (Ridings et al. 2019) . Alternatively, community-based interventions may be suitable for community-based vicarious trauma (Hanson et al. 2019) . Prevention of children's vicarious traumatization may also be possible if children are provided clinical services to inform them about the trauma of family and friends in age-appropriate ways and to help them to cope with the trauma material. This is particularly true for populations most vulnerable for vicarious trauma exposure such as adolescents, girls, and Black children.",

This distinction is important given that extant models implicate traumatized caregivers in children's vicarious traumatization (Scheeringa et al. 2013) . This study suggests that safety interventions should be implemented to protect children from those who perpetrate violence against children's family and close friends because they put them at risk for vicarious traumatization. As such, it provides support for the development of policies and practices that allow social workers, law enforcement, and the courts to intervene in the lives of children exposed to the violent victimization of others.",

As such, clinicians working with Black children should be prepared to assess for trauma symptoms and to implement trauma informed services, as appropriate. However, they should also appreciate the resilience of Black communities, as demonstrated by this study. This study found that, despite their elevated rates of trauma exposure, they Black children demonstrated greater resilience against trauma symptoms than other ethnic groups. Thus, mental health and social work practitioners should approach Black children with an understanding of the resilience of Black communities and an appreciation for the cultural values and perspectives upon which it is based (Williams et al. 2014; Hall-Clark et al. 2017) . Practitioners should operate from a strengths perspective and seek to highlight and enhance the strengths of Black communities.",

The study found evidence that children may be directly traumatized by learning about the violent victimization of family and close friends. This relationship was observed independent of caregiver impairment. The study also found that adolescents, girls, and Black children may be increased risk to encounter vicarious trauma, and White children may be at increased risk to have traumatic reactions to the trauma material of other. This suggests a need for targeted interventions aimed at protecting children from adverse outcomes. The findings also support and give validity to policies and practices that allow social workers, law enforcement, and the courts to intervene in the lives of vulnerable children who live in homes and communities where violence is prevalent.",
