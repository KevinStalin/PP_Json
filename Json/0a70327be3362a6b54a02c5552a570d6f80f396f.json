We de novo assembled an \"A\" allele using PacBio 409 whole genome sequence data from one of our Bamaxiang animals. We confirmed the 410 boundaries of the 2.3 Kb deletion and showed that it results from an intra-chromosomal 411 recombination between SINE elements (Fig. 5Aand Suppl.Fig. 4A). The four top SNPs in Fig. 4124D mapped within 2.1 Kb from the 2.3Kb deletion. We developed a PCR test and genotyped 413 all F0, F6 and F7 animals for the \"O\" deletion. Three of the four top SNPs were in perfect LD 414 with the deletion in the F0 generation and near-perfect ( 2 \u2265 0.94) in the F6 and F7 415 generations (Fig. 4D). None of the four non-synonymous ABO variants had an independent 416 effect on OTU-476 or 327 abundance. We mapped cecal RNA-Seq data from AA, AO and OO 417 individuals on the Bamaxiang A reference allele.

The encoded truncated 423 protein misses seven of the eight substrate binding sites and seven of the eight active sites 424 reported by Wang et al. (2015). The proportion of reads mapping to the seventh intron was 425 higher for the O than for the A allele pointing towards less efficient splicing of the alternative 426 intron.

Of the 3,111 MAGs, 248 were assigned to the family transport systems (TR), and (iii) to be converted into intermediates of central metabolism by number) implicated in GalNAc utilization (TR/CP) from the literature (Brinkk\u00f6tter et al., 2000; 540 Rodionov et al., 2010; Leyn et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2012; Biddart et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; 541 Ravcheev & Thiele, 2017, Zuniga et al., 2018). These encode (i) 11 components of one of 542 three GalNAc transporter systems (AgaPTS: agaE, agaF, agaV, agaW; TonB dependent 543 transporter: omp, agaP, agaK; GnbPTS: gnbA, gnbB, gnbC, gnbD), (ii) two GalNAc-6P 544 deacetylases (agaA, nagA), (iii) two galactosamine-6P (GalN-6P) isomerase and/or 545 deaminases (agaI, agaS), (iv) three tagatose-6P kinases (pfka, lacC, fruK), (v) four tagatose-546 1,6-PP aldolases or aldolase subunits (gatY-kbaY, gatZ-kbaZ, lacD, fba), and (vi) two regulon 547", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF10": {"text": "570Examination of the genome of the two OTU476-like strains revealed clustering of eight 571GalNAc genes including orthologues of the four components of the AgaPTS transporter 572 system (agaE, agaF, agaV, agaW), of nagA deacetylase, of agaS deaminase/isomerase, of 573 fruK kinase, and of the gatZ-kbaZ aldolase subunit.

(B) Expression profile in a panel of adult and embryonic 613 porcine tissues (own RNA-Seq data). 616 617 No effect of ABO genotype on intestinal microbiota composition in human. 618 The effect of ABO genotype on intestinal microbiota composition in humans remains 619 somewhat controversial. Despite suggestive evidence in a small (n=71) cohort of separate 620 microbiota-based clustering of AB and B vs A and O individuals (secretors only) (Makivuokko 621 et al., 2012), a subsequent study conducted in a larger cohort (n=1,503) could not detect 622 experiment-wide significant effects of either secretor or ABO genotype on gut microbiota 623 composition (Davenport et al., 2016). Intriguingly, the latter study nevertheless reported a 624 possible effect of ABO genotype on a rare OTU (592616) assigned to Erysipelotrichaceae. 625 We took advantage of an available intestinal 16S rRNA dataset of ~300 healthy individuals of 626 European descent to re-examine this question in light of the results obtained in the pig 627 (Momozawa et al., 2018). All individuals were genotyped with the OmniExpress SNP array 628 (Illumina) and imputed to whole genome. ABO genotype was inferred from the genotypes at 629 three coding variants (rs8176719, rs7853989, rs8176747) following Cooling (2015). The 630 frequency of the different genotypes in the cohort were: 0.37 (OO), 0.37 (AO), 0.11 (BO), 0.08 631 (AA) and 0.06 (AB). Twenty-one percent of the individuals in the cohort were non-secretors 632 (homozygous for the W143X mutation in the FUT2 gene) (Kelly et al., 1995). For each 633 individual we obtained V1-V2, V3-V4 and V5-V6 16S rRNA sequences from intestinal biopsies 634 (cfr. Methods). 16S rRNA sequences were clustered in OTUs using DNACLUST (Ghodsi et al., 635 2011) with a 97% similarity threshold. Forty-three (V1-V2), 20 (V3-V4) and nine (V5-V6) OTUs 636with abundance >0.001% across locations and amplicons were assigned to group on OTU abundance was tested using a linear model including blood group (AA, AO, AB 639 versus rest, BB, BO, BB versus rest, OO versus rest), secretor status, sex, age, smoking status 640 and BMI (cfr. Methods). There was no convincing evidence for an effect of ABO blood group 641 on the abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae OTU (Suppl.Fig. 6). The SILVA database does not 642 include genus p-75-a5. We directly mapped the 16S rRNA reads to the Greengenes database 643(DeSantis et al., 2006). Putative p-75-a5 reads were detected in five individuals only (four 644 OO and one AO) in which they accounted for 0.003%-0.25% of the reads. Volcano and QQ plots for 43 (V1-V2), 20 (V3-V4) and 9 (V5-V6) OTUs classified 648 as Erysipelotrichaceae for the contrasts (A) [AA, AO and AB] versus [BB, BO and OO], (B) [BB, Discussion host genetics on the composition of the intestinal microbiota of the pig. More than 30 million 655 variants with MAF \u2265 3% segregate in this population, i.e. more than one variant every 100 656 base pairs. This is slightly lower than the 40 million high quality variants segregating in the 657 mouse collaborative cross (Srivastava et al., 2017). The average nucleotide diversity ( , i.e. 658 the proportion of sites that differ between two chromosomes sampled at random in the 659 population(s)) within the four Chinese founder breeds was ~2.5x10 -3 and within the four 660 European founder breeds ~2.0x10 -3 . By comparison, -values in African and Asian/European 661 human populations are ~9x10 -4 and ~8x10 -4 , respectively (Yu et al., 2001; The 1,000 662 Genomes Project Consortium, 2010). Thus, against intuition (as domestication is often 663 assumed to have severely reduced effective population size) the within population diversity 664 is > 2-fold higher in domestic pigs than in human populations, as previously reported (Frantz 665 et al., 2015; Charlier et al., 2016; Georges et al., 2019). Nucleotide diversities between 666 Chinese and between European founder breeds were ~3.6x10 -3 and ~2.5x10 -3 , i.e. 1.44-fold 667 and 1.25-fold higher than the respective within breed -values. These -values are of the 668 same order of magnitude as the sequence divergence between Homo sapiens and 669 Neanderthals/Denosivans (~3x10 -3 , Sankararaman et al., 2014). By comparison, -values 670 between Africans, Asians and Europeans are typically \u2264 ~1x10 -3 (Yu et al., 2001). The 671 nucleotide diversity between Chinese and European breeds averaged ~4.3x10 -3 . This -value 672 is similar to the divergence between M. domesticus and M. castaneus (Geraldes et al., 2008), 673 and close to halve the ~1% difference between chimpanzee and human (Patterson et al., 674 2006). Note that Chinese and European pig breeds are derived from Chinese and European 675 wild boars, respectively, which are thought to have diverged ~1 million years ago (Groenen, 676 2016), while M. domesticus and M. castaneus are thought to have diverged \u2264 500,000 years 677 ago (Geraldes et al., 2008).

Thus, as for overall microbiota composition, the impact of genetics on abundance 733 of individual taxa appeared highest for feces of mature animals. It is noteworthy that the 734 family with highest heritability in humans (Christensenellaceae) also ranked amongst the top 735 raking taxa in the pig data. 736 Heritability does not accurately foretell the genetic architecture of traits. Phenotypes with 737 low heritability may be affected by variants with major effects (f.i. Kadri et al., 2014), while 738 highly heritable traits may have \"omnigenic\" architecture (Boyle et al., 2017; Yengo et al., 739 2018). To gain insight in the genetic architecture of gut microbiota composition in this 740 population we performed GWAS. We identified more than 1,500 signals (corresponding each 741 to a lead SNP x taxon combination) exceeding the genome-wide 5x10 -8 significance threshold 742 in at least one of the 12 data series. That these include true positive signals was most 743 convincingly demonstrated by the marked shifts towards low p-values when examining the One signal on the telomeric end of chromosome 1 clearly stood out above background noise gene that results from a 2.3 Kb deletion eliminating 63% of the acetyl-galactosaminyl 750 transferase protein sequence. The corresponding O allele was shown to segregate at 751 moderate to high frequency in the eight founder breeds of the mosaic population, in Chinese, 752 Russian and West-European wild boar populations, and in Sus cebifrons, a suidae that 753 diverged from the ancestor of the pig ~3.5 million years ago. To gain additional insights in 754 the age of the porcine O allele, we generated phylogenetic trees of the A and O alleles of 14 755 AA and 34 OO animals including domestic pigs, wild boars, Visayan and Javanese warty pigs, 756 and common African warthog. Examination of their local SNP genotypes (50K window 757 encompassing the ABO gene) reveals traces of ancestral recombinations between O and A 758 haplotypes as close as 300 and 800 base pairs from the proximal and distal deletion 759 breakpoints, respectively, as well as multiple instances of homoplasy that may either be due 760 to recombination, gene conversion or recurrent de novo mutations. On their own, these 761 signatures support the old age of the O allele. We constructed UPGMA trees based on 762 nucleotide diversity for windows ranging from 500-bp to 40-Kb centered on the 2.3-Kb 763 deletion. Smaller windows have a higher likelihood to compare the genuine ancestral O 764 versus A states, yet yield less robust trees because they are based on smaller number of 765 variants.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF14": {"text": "in this and other related species as well. 775 This situation in suidae is reminiscent of the trans-species polymorphism of the ABO gene in 776 primates attributed to balancing selection (S\u00e9gurel et al., 2012). The phenotype driving 777 balancing selection remain largely unknown yet a tug of war with pathogens is usually invoked: synthesized glycans may affect pathogen adhesion, toxin binding or act as soluble decoys, (Ellinghaus et al., 2020) and schistosomiasis (Camus et al., 1977; Pereira et al., 1979; Ndamba 783 et al., 1997), while being a possible risk factor for cholera (Chaudhuri and De, 1977), H. pylori 784 (Boren et al., 1993) and norovirus infection (Lindesmith et al., 2003). Whatever the underlying 785 selective force, it appears to have operated independently in at least two mammalian 786 branches (primates and suidae), over exceedingly long periods of time, and over broad 787 geographic ranges, hence pointing towards its pervasive nature. To gain insights in what 788 selective forces might underpin the observed balanced polymorphism, we tested the effect 789of ABO genotype on >150 traits measured in the F6 and F7 generations pertaining to carcass 790 composition, growth, meat quality, hematological parameters, disease resistance and 791", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF15": {"text": ". 5A&B). One of its substrates is the heavily glycosylated mucins constituting the intestinal 816 mucus. Mucosal glycans can be used as carbon source by intestinal microorganisms 817 (Mahowald et al., 2009). Glycans first need to be degraded, and the released 818 monosaccharides then imported and catabolized.

Closer examination of the structure of the most complete 862 GalNAc gene clusters in the studied MAGs (Fig. 6C) revealed an alternative, possible clue. The 863 GalNAc gene clusters of the non-Erysipelotrichaceae species all have the features expected 864 from genuine regulons. The relevant ORFs tend to be adjacent to each other (spanning 865 ~10Kb) and on the same strand, hence compatible with poly-cistronic messenger RNAs 866 enabling coregulated expression. In striking contrast, the ORFs of the GalNAc clusters of the 867 OTU476-like strains and at least one studied Erysipelotrichaceae are spanning respectively 868 ~50 and ~30Kb, and appear to be distributed randomly on both strands. Most importantly, 869 neither genome contained orthologues of agaR (K02081) or gntR (K03710), which are 870 encoding negative regulators of GalNAc regulons and were observed in all other GalNAc-rich 871 MAGs. It is noteworthy that out of the 77 Erysipelotrichaceae MAGs encompassing an 872 orthologue of agaS, only two (=2.6%) had an orthologue of agaR or gntR in its vicinity. This AgaS colocalization in OTU476-like strains is likely coincidental. Taken together, this suggests 879 that, contrary to E. Coli and other bacterial species, the OTU476-like strains and some 880 Erysipelotrichaceae are not endowed with the capacity to sense GalNAc concentrations in the 881 medium and only induce expression of the genes and proteins necessary for GalNAc 882 utilization when needed (Leyn et al., 2012; Biddart et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015), but may 883 rather express their GalNAc-related genes constitutively. The GalNAc gene cluster as seen in 884 the OTU476-like strains is a possible evolutionary intermediate towards the formation of a 885 genuine regulon as seen in E.Coli, already facilitating horizontal transmission of a \"selfish\" 886 functional gene ensemble even if not yet adaptively coregulated (Lawrence, 1999). This 887 testable hypothesis (constitutive versus inducible expression) suggests an alternative modus 888 operandi of the chromosome 1 QTL. Against intuition, bacteria affected by the mQTL (i.e. 889 OTU-476, OTU-327, p-75-a5 and some other Erysipelotrichaceae) may very well not be at an 890 advantage when GalNAc is present at high concentration in the intestinal content (as in AA 891and AO animals), but rather at a disadvantage when GalNAc is present at low concentrations 892 (as in OO animals) because then they waste energy transcribing and translating useless genes. 893", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF17": {"text": "as compared to hunter-gatherers and agro-pastoralists) possibly as a result of interaction 911 with livestock (Malmuthuge et al., 2014; Hansen et al., 2019).

For each Chinese breed, the 977 boars were mated with the ewes of one European breed, and the sows with the boars of another 978 European breed to produce the F1 generation. Thus, every Chinese and every European breed 979 is parent breed of two distinct F1 hybrid combinations each, for a total of eight F1 combinations 980 (BX-LW, BX-PT, LA-PT, LA-LD, TB-LD, TB-WD, EH-WD, EH-LW). The F2 generation 981 was obtained by mating each F1 hybrid combination with two others that did not share parental 982 breeds for a total of eight F2 combinations (BX-LW x LA-PT, BX-PT x LA-LD, LA-PT x TB-983 LD, LA-LD x TB-WD, TB-LD x EH-WD, TB-WD x EH-LW, EH-WD x BX-LW, EH-LW x 984 BX-PT).

Every F3 combination was obtained by reciprocally 991 crossing an average of 7 boars from one F2 combination with an average of 10.8 sows from 992 the complementary one.

Animals were slaughtered at day 240. Ileum and cecum 1006 were sealed at both ends with a sterile rope and extracted from the carcass. Within 30 min after 1007 slaughter, ileal and cecal luminal content were collected (F6 and F7 animals), ileum and cecum 1008 rinsed with sterile saline solution, and samples of ileal and cecal mucosa scraped with a sterile 1009 microscopic slide (F7 animals only). Approximately one gram of content or scrapings was 1010 packed in 2-ml sterile freezer tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80\u00b0C.

The average h 2 obtained across permuted datasets was subtracted from the h 2 1137 obtained with the real (i.e. unpermuted) data to yield an unbiased estimate h 2 . The statistical 1138 significance of h 2 was estimated as the proportion of permutations that would yield a value of 1139 h 2 that would be as high or higher than the value of h 2 obtained with the real data. To provide 1140 further support for the validity of the h 2 estimates, we measured Spearman's correlation 1141 between F6 and F7 estimates (both h 2 and corresponding \u2212log(p) values) computed with the 1142 corr.test R function.

It was 1148applied to all SNPs with MAF \u2265 0.05 (in the corresponding data series) and taxa with non-null 1149 abundance in at least 20% of samples (in the corresponding data series), ignoring samples with 1150 null abundance if those represented more than 5% of samples. The second fitted a logistic 1151 regression model between allelic dosage and taxon presence/absence in the corresponding 1152 sample (binary model). It was applied to all SNPs with MAF \u2265 10% (in the corresponding 1153 data series) and taxa present in \u2265 20% and \u2264 95% of samples (in the corresponding data series). 1154", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF20": {"text": "Van der Auwera et al., 2013). We replaced the ABO gene of the Sus scrofa build 11.1 genome 1228 with the 50 Kb Bamaxiang contig sequence containing the A allele of ABO gene. The cleaned 1229 reads of the 22 individuals were aligned to the modified Sus scrofa reference genome (build Phylogenetic analysis of the O alleles in the Sus genus. We applied GATK to perform indel 1233 realignment, and proceeded to SNP and INDEL discovery and genotyping with 1234 UnifiedGenotyper across all 83 samples simultaneously using standard hard filtering 1235 parameters according to GATK Best Practices recommendations (DePristo et al., 2011). We 1236 restricted the analysis to the 14 AA and 34 OO animals (Fig. 5C), hence circumventing the 1237 need to phase the corresponding genotypes. We defined windows of varying size (0.5 to 50Kb) 1238 centered around the 2.3 Kb deletion. For all pairs of individuals, we computed a running sum 1239 over all variants in the window adding 0 when both animals had genotype AA (alternate) or 1240 RR(reference), 1 when one animal was AA and the other RR, and 0.5 in all other cases. The 1241 nucleotide diversity for the corresponding animal pair was then computed as the running sum 1242 divided by the window size in bp. We ignored the variants located in the 2.3 Kb deletion in 1243 this computation. The ensuing matrix of pair-wise nucleotide diversities was then used for 1244 hierarchical clustering and dendrogram construction using the hclust(method=\"average\") R 1245 function corresponding to the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA). 1246 1247 Analysis of population differentiation. We quantified the degree of population differentiation 1248 by computing the effect of breed on the variance of allelic dosage using a standard one-way 1249 ANOVA fixed effect model and a F-statistic computed as the ratio of the \"between breed mean 1250 squares\" (BMS) and \"within breed mean squares\" (WMS) (Weir & Cockerham, 1984). ij is the allelic dosage of the alternate allele in individual j (of n i ) of breed i (of B), y i \u0305 1255 is the average allelic dosage in breed i (of B), and y T \u0305\u0305\u0305 is the average allelic dosage in the entire 1256 data set. We computed the average of the corresponding F-statistic for all variants within a 1257 sliding window of fixed physical size (f.i. 2-Kb in Fig. 5E), and took the inverse of this mean those obtained by computing average FST values across variants (and taking the inverse) 3'). The isolates were stored at -80 \u2103 in GAM broth containing 16% of glycerol until further 1290 use. 1291 medium. Cells were harvested at the period of logarithmic growth. Genomic DNA was 1294 extracted using the Blood & Cell Culture DNA Midi Kit (Qiagen, Germany) following the 1295 manufacturer's protocol. Libraries for whole-genome sequencing of the strains were 1296 constructed and sequenced on an ONT PromethION (Oxford Nanopore Technology, UK) at 1297 NextOmics (Wuhan, China). To correct sequencing errors, a library for second-generation 1298 sequencing was also constructed for each of the two strains and sequenced (2x100 bp) on a 1299 BGISEQ platform (BGI, China). Bioinformatic analyses of sequencing data were performed 1300 following Kolmogorov et al. (2019) and Hunt et al. (2015). In brief, after quality control, the 1301 sequence data were assembled with flye (Kolmogorov et al., 2019) with parameter: --nano-raw, 1302 and the assembled genomes were corrected by combining the Oxford Nanopore data with the 1303 second-generation sequencing data using pilon under default parameter. The encoded genes 1304 were predicted using prodial (parameter: -p none-g 11) (Hyatt et al., 2010). 1305 1306 MAGs assembly. A total of 92 fecal samples from eight pig populations, four intestinal 1307 locations and different ages were used for metagenomic sequencing and construction of 1308 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). Microbial DNA was extracted as described above. 1309 The libraries for metagenomic sequencing were constructed following the manufacturer's 1310 instructions (Illumina, USA), with an insert size of 350 base pairs (bp) for each sample, and 1311 2x150 bp paired-ends sequenced on a Novaseq 6000 platform. Raw sequencing data were 1312 filtered to remove adapter sequences and low-quality reads using fastp (v0.19.41) (Chen et al., 1313 2018). Host genomic DNA sequences were filtered out using BWA (V.0.7.17) (Li & Durbin, 1314 2010).
