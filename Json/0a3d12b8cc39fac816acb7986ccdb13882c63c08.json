Individuals with COVID-19 will experience high levels of stress, depression, anxiety, and low quality of life. The goals the of present study were to investigate the effect of brief crisis intervention package on stress, depression, anxiety, and quality of life in patient with COVID-19. Method: In this randomized controlled clinical trial, 30 patients were randomly selected and divided into control and experimental groups. The experimental group was examined in four 60-minute sessions for one month. During this period, the control group received only routine treatment and therapy. Before and after the intervention, DASS21, the Symptom Checklist (SCL-25), and WHO-QOL were used to measure and record patient mental health and quality of life. Finally, data were analyzed using SPSS 24 software. Results: The average mental health score was assessed with WHO-QOL, DASS21, and SCL-25 before intervention and was not statistically significant (P = > 0.05), and the mean score of stress, anxiety, depression, WHO-QOL, SCL-25 after intervention was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Therefore, results showed the brief crisis intervention package was effective in improving the quality of life (P < 0.05) and mental illnesses (P < 0.05) in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion: The brief crisis intervention package can reduce the negative effect of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this intervention can be used as a beneficial treatment to improve mental disorder symptoms and to improve the condition of people who suffer from COVID-19.",

            "text": "In another research, the results showed the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce stress and cure sleep durations need to be made available to the homequarantined people (1) . Researchers have estimated the life expectancy of people with severe stress to be between 13 and 30 years less than healthy people (8) . At the individual level, despite the catastrophic events, the COVID-19 prevalence has been a constant crisis for all members of the society. Stressful events, such as natural or unnatural disasters and human injuries, can have a significant effect on mental health and can occur in conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression (9) . However, the impact of acute, pervasive, persistent, social and psychological stressors on the prevalence of highly infectious and deadly diseases (10) is not well understood. In addition, there is little information about the prevalence and risk factors for mental health problems when faced with such stressors. Studies of the prevalence of SARS in 2003 found that during the epidemics, different groups of people, from the general public to health care workers, have varying degrees of psychological problems, such as fear and anxiety (11) PTSD, and depression (12) . In another study in Wuhan, China, the results showed the mental health problems of parents of children hospitalized during an epidemic were more serious and that anxiety and depression were more pronounced (13) . In a study, Banerjee (2020) advises the psychiatrists to use 5 components in their interventions to decrease mental disorders caused by COVID19, which are as follow: 1. Providing advises for psychological health promotion; people at risk can be educated about acute stress, health, anxiety, and fear of COVID or substance abuse. 2. Encouraging health-related behaviors: People need to go to reputable sources of information to prevent wrongdoing when a crisis occurs, and false information should be avoided . 3. The integration of existing health care by psychiatrists through the teaching of important topics can play an important role in improving the quality of care during the COVID19 pandemic, so that other medical staff become aware of the needs of mental health and make crucial interventions in such critical circumstances. 4. In this case, we need to help people learn problemsolving skills and make decisions in critical situations, and use this skill to choose the right solution, such as avoiding cultural meetings, avoiding travel, etc. Also, they have to replace various forms of social communication (for example, using cyberspace instead of face-to-face visiting.) 5. Empowering patients, their families, and medical staff.",

Demographically, 53.3% of the participants were female and 46.7% male. The participants' ages ranged from 20-70 years. Also, 36.6% were single, and 63.4% married; moreover, 46.6% held a high school diploma or less, 36.7% a bachelor's degree, and 16.7% MSc degree or higher ( Table 2) . All patients filled out the questionnaire without data leakage. The mean\u00b1SD scores of DASS, quality of life, and SCL-25 between control and intervention group before and after intervention were reported ( Table  3 ).The mean scores of S-Cl-25, DASS21, and WHO-QOL-BRIEF before intervention in the 2 groups was not statistically significant (P > 0.05) (Table 3) , the t-test results also showed that the average score of depression, anxiety, and stress after intervention was statistically significant (P < 0.05) ( Table 3 ). Compared to the control group, the experimental group had reduced depression, anxiety, and stress levels and their quality of life improved after 4 intervention sessions ( Table 3) . The results of ANCOVA showed significant differences between the experimental and control groups in quality of life, depression, anxiety, stress, and mental health in the posttest stage (P < 0.05) ( Table 4 ). Therefore, crisis intervention could improve the health-related quality of life of patients with COVID-19. Most of the participants showed improvement after 4 sessions of crisis intervention. An overwhelming majority of participants were able to manage stress, depression, and anxiety symptoms after the intervention program. Therefore, this program addresses stress, depression, and anxiety and also helps reduce mental illnesses and increase quality of life.",

            "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of crisis intervention in patients with COVID-19. The results showed brief crisis intervention package is an effective way to reduce anxiety, depression, stress, and improve quality of life in patients with COVID-19 . Previous studies showed the effect of relaxation therapy on anxiety levels in young women (24) with early breast cancer (25) . Our study found crisis intervention affects the quality of life in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the impact of this technique on quality of life and found that crisis intervention can reduce complications and improve quality of life (26) . Seyedi et al also showed that relaxation therapy can reduce fatigue and improve sleep quality in patients with COPD (27) . The reason for the decrease in depression, anxiety, and stress of patients with COVID19 after crisis intervention may be the balance between the anterior and hypothalamic nucleus. By reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, side effects of stress and anxiety can be prevented, and physical and mental relaxation can be increased (28) . Similar to other studies, patients in this study achieved relaxation by learning how to regularly tighten and relax muscles and change their mind and identify symptoms of stress. Also, Carlbring et al (2018) showed that cognitive behavior therapy was as effective as face-to-face treatment for depressive symptoms, social anxiety disorder, and other psychological or somatic disorders (29) . According to Jeong et al (2016) , for Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), they reported that the period of the disease lasts between 8 to 37 days. Standard recommendations for preventing the outbreak of MERS include handwashing, avoiding raw foods, wearing a mask, and practicing social distancing. However, these recommendations are not adhered to by people with mental illness (30) . Zandifar and Badrfam (2020) reported the effect of COVID-19 on mental health and found health anxiety, fear of death, fear of losing social connections, and fear of losing family members were some of the social stressors that led to mental illness during COVID-19, which if not treated, it will lead to chronic mental illness in the future (31) . Therefore, it can be concluded that due to the negative emotional effects of this disease, effective and even short-term psychological interventions for patients with this disease can prevent chronic mental illness and may also prevent disease in the patient's entourage. We found that patients of the intervention group exhibited significantly reduced levels of stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms compared to those of the control group, indicating that our intervention showed a rapid improvement on mood disturbance (6) , and thus it should be applied in the management of psychological distress in COVID-19 patients. Dubey et al (2020) reported that to better deal with these psychosocial issues in patients with COVID-19, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models must be immediately performed by the health services, health care personnel, and other stakeholders (32) . According to the results of this study, crisis intervention has a positive effect on improving quality of life and mental health in patients with COVID-19. Due to the strong contagion of COVID-19, isolation treatment and the effects of drugs on patients increase their levels of anxiety and mental disorders. Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that this treatment package be provided to psychologists and psychiatrists involved with COVID-19 disease and be compared with other therapies. Based on our knowledge, it is the first time that the efficacy of this crisis package intervention has been evaluated for COVID-19 patients with psychological distress. However, more studies should be done with larger samples to increase the generalizability of the results. Although the efficacy of this method has been confirmed in addiction studies, suicide prevention, and natural disasters (23, (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) , this was the first time that this method was used in patients with COVID-19. Based on previous studies, patients experience acute anxiety and stress after the onset of COVID-19 and the onset of symptoms due to the unknown nature of the disease, which can sometimes lead to depression and lifestyle changes. To sum it up, brief crisis intervention helps to reduce stress among patients by creating empathy and teaching adaptive skills in the second and third sessions, which can lead to increased patient resilience in the face of COVID-19, ultimately reducing patient anxiety. In the fourth session, an attempt was made to encourage patients to make a metacognitive change, which improves their quality of life. Finally, given the significant reduction in stress and depression after a short intervention, it can be concluded that reducing the scores of these 2 components (stress and anxiety) will eventually lead to further reduction of depression and lifestyle changes.",

Second, the sample size of each group was comparatively small, which limited its statistical power to interpret real effects. Third, the study period of 1 month was comparatively short for efficacy appraisal. Taken together, the results of the present study need to be stabilized in further studies that resolve those limitations. Forth, due to the need for intervention, mental health promotion and the use of the results of this study, it was not possible to perform the follow-up phase, but the main purpose of this intervention was to improve mental health during the disease (3 weeks) and not after the disease.",

The results showed confirmatory factor analyses show a good fitness with 7 factor fundamental model. Also, SCL-25 has a high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha between 0.71 to 0.95) and split-half coefficient (0.65 to 0.96) for subscales and the whole scale score(21).",
