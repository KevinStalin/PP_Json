For clinicians, keeping current on medical literature is challenging in normal times but even more demanding during the COVID-19 pandemic, when their abilities are stretched to the limit. Moreover, given the limited capacity of humans (including physicians) to apply probabilistic reasoning [5] , integration of published evidence probably remains mostly at the intuitive level in the minds of clinicians. This state of affairs calls for equipping clinicians with reliable tools to properly evaluate the abundant empirical knowledge, and properly weigh it against their own patients' data. Many current EHR systems document the information required by the calculator in a machine-readable format, allowing for Our study shows that risk assessment could to be done automatically (without active physician involvement),. Automatic extraction of information and risk calculation performed in the background as patients present to the hospital can reduce reducing the time and effort required from physicians for risk assessment, . It can also assure that policy makers are provided a complete view of predicted disease burden for continuous monitoring.",

In an effort to avoid overwhelming the healthcare system capacity, further lifting of restrictions on social interactions is thus delayed until the effects of policy changes can be measured. The turnaround time for policy-makers to get feedback on policy changes is therefore around two weeks. Our results provide reason to believe that future critical illness can be reliably predicted at the time of admission.Such predictions may be used in triage to make sure that high risk patients remain where medical care is rapidly available, or to select patients for (investigational) interventions. At the institutional and healthcare system level, predicting the future burden of critical illness could improve allocation of resources (e.g., personnel and supplies) to preempt shortages. At the State and National levels, such predictions could shorten the feedback turnaround time, allowing policy makers to effectively flatten the epidemic curve and avoid breakdown of medical care, while minimizing restrictions on the workforce to curb the financial crisis.",

The validation population was relatively small and taken from a single hospital. The paucity of critically ill patients in our cohort may contribute to the high area under the ROC curve.

As new research is published, other calculators could be developed. Based on local circumstances, a calculator using predictors from the most relevant study could be used. Moreover, several calculators could be applied in parallel, and calculator voting used to derive potentially more robust predictions. Integration with EHR systems can facilitate automatic data extraction, which could make the use of such tools more user friendly and practical.",

Thus, we did not include the week of presentation as a feature in the risk calculator. Petrilli et al provided OR's for missing data on predictors, and these were used in our risk calculator.Validation processWe studied patients admitted to the Rabin Medical Center, HaSharon Campus, a teaching medical center at Petach Tikva, Israel. HaSharon Hospital was designated a coronavirus care center, to which COVID-19 patients residing in Central Israel were referred. Included were patients hospitalized starting from March 9, 2020 with confirmed Covid-19, defined as a positive result on real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab specimens. This was done using a kit by Seegene(Songpa-gu, South Korea). At the time of data extraction, there were no patients still hospitalized who had not reached the composite outcome. Patients' electronic health records were reviewed by two clinicians (MTK and RM) and relevant demographic data, clinical findings and results of the first laboratory and imaging studies done during the admission were extracted. Based on their state at the time of data extraction, patients were determined to have critical illness (at least one of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation or death; no COVID-19patients were transferred to hospice care) or non-critical disease. Extracted data was then loaded to the risk calculator and analysis of the relationship between predicted risk and actual outcome was performed. A threshold score for predicting critical illness was empirically selected based on actual patient scores such that optimized discrimination between patients with critical and non-critical illness. The risk calculator tool is freely available on the Web at https://coronavirus.kahun.com/Calculate/the results of an analysis performed by Petrilli on a population of COVID-19 in NY to develop a risk calculator for critical illness.
