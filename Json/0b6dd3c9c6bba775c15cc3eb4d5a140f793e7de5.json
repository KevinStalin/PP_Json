This work presents an analysis of the development of lamb meat consumption at two points in time, 2004 and 2014, before and in the midst of the economic crisis in Spain (2007)(2008)(2009)(2010)(2011)(2012)(2013)(2014)(2015)(2016)(2017). Our findings show that together with the external appearance and against the backdrop of an economic recession, price has a greater impact on consumers' purchasing decisions than origin and quality seals, despite these being attributes that are traditionally used as a guarantee of food safety and traceability.
