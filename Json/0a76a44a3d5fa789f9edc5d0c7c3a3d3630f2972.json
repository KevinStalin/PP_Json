The protocol design allows multiple therapeutic agents to be evaluated in an efficient and scientifically rigorous manner, with efficiencies delivered by the MAMS design, and began by studying neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. TICO employs an agile and robust approach to futility and safety evaluation at 300 patients enrolled (Stage 1), with subsequent expansion to full sample size and an expanded target population (Stage 2) if the agent shows an acceptable safety profile and evidence of efficacy. Two ordinal outcomes applied early (Day 5) determine the efficacy signals of the investigational agents(s) and progression to Stage 2. These ordinal outcomes assess both respiratory and other organ failure events, recognizing the broad range of COVID-19 morbidity. In Stage 2, overall efficacy is assessed using the primary outcome of 'time to sustained recovery' assessed over 90 days. This approach to early futility assessment using an early intermediate outcome and a primary endpoint out to 90 days allows the study team to make rapid decisions on safety and potential efficacy of novel agents while ultimately focusing on patient-centered, longer-term outcomes. The implementation of TICO across a global network allows for continued enrollment despite variations in geographic epidemiology.",

Regulatory approval for study of this agent has been received in the U.S., Denmark, U.K., Spain and Singapore. Between August 5 and October 13, 2020, 326 participants were enrolled. On the 26 th of October Ly-CoV-555 underwent Stage 1 futility and safety assessment. The result of this assessment will be the subject of a separate report. Two agents (both nMABs) will be submitted for regulatory approval in November 2020, with additional agents expected subsequently. The number of clinical sites and countries that will participate in the study of additional agents will expand substantially, facilitating rapid assessment of both planned and future agents.

The study is currently underway in multiple countries and can respond to fluctuations in infection and recruitment rates across geographical areas. Finally, the provision of remdesivir (unless contraindicated), as well as the flexibility to incorporate new SOC in the future, ensures that any agent in this study is evaluated for efficacy in combination with the most current SOC.

In an attempt to best utilize the global network of sites and respond to the changing nature of global infection rates, the study distinguishes between 'registered', 'activated' and 'open' sites. Sites are registered when they have all appropriate regulatory and registration documentation in place and are trained in all relevant protocol procedures, but only activated when there is evidence of a current or imminent spike in disease activity in the site's catchment area.
