Use of preprint servers such as medRxiv and bioRxiv, which make first versions of papers openly available within a day or two of submission, has soared (Barbour, 2020) . Rapid and open publishing (Calloway, 2020) has become expected for STM research, particularly during the pandemic. Indeed, 'even before COVID-19 spread around the globe, momentum was growing to share results early online and to make work open access' (Calloway, 2020) . Will this style of publishing that includes quick turnaround times and a focus on OA continue as we enter the final months of 2020 and in the future? How will those without a breadth of resources, such as smaller publishers or societies, continue current trends such as quick peer review and open publishing, sustainably, particularly in HSS?",

Over the last few months, there have been many successful online conferences, launches, events, and meetings which have never before taken place online, such as the University Press Redux Online 2020, which was hosted by Cambridge Open Engage. MIT Press saw a full season of book events cancelled in spring and instead made 'a transition from festivals, book tours, launches, and conferences to a fully digital events landscape' (Nyren & Stileman, 2020) . Despite the grim economic picture, all areas of the scholarly communications industry have ploughed ahead, altering the way we work to meet the needs of academics and universities. Inevitably, some have made more headway than others, and only time will tell how the pandemic will reshape the industry in the long term. The January 2021 special issue of Learned Publishing will address how the COVID-19 crisis is changing the way we work, how we plan, and where we invest as an industry, and perhaps looking back at the final quarter of 2020 will bring us some clarity about the changes which are here to stay.",
