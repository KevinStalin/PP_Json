            "text": "Recent studies have pointed the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme-II (ACE2) in mediating the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the host cell by binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viral spike protein, and successive priming by cellular proteases initiates the infection. SARS-CoV replication rate and disease severity is controlled by the binding affinity of RBD with ACE2. To understand, how mutations in the conserved residues of RBD affect the molecular interaction with ACE2, we generated five alanine mutants i.e. Y449A, N487A, Y489A, N501A and Y505A in the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the ACE2-RBD SARS-CoV-2 complex (PDB: 6M0J). Computational site directed mutagenesis induced dynamics in wild-type and mutant complexes were extensively studied through all-atoms molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of 150 ns. In silico mutational analysis revealed loss of important intermolecular hydrogen bonds and other non-bonded contacts, critical for molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to ACE2, which is well supported by saturation mutagenesis study of binding interface residues. MD simulations results showed that RBM motif is flexible, where mutant residues are relatively more mobile than corresponding wild-type residues. Global motion analysis through principal component studies revealed that RBD exhibits protuberant in-ward motion towards the human ACE2 binding interface which may be crucial for molecular interaction. Conclusively, the present finding are in congruence with previous experimental reports and provides detailed information on the structural basis of receptor binding by human SARS-CoV-2, which will crucial for the development of novel inhibitors or drugs to combat against SARS-CoV-2.",

Consistent with high sequence and structural similarity, protein-protein binding assays corroborated the important role of ACE2 in mediating SARS-CoV-2 viral attachment and entry Walls et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . A recent report on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike showed that the RBD domain of spike protein binds to the peptidase domain of ACE2 (Wrapp et al., 2020) . It has been also observed that host susceptibility to SARS-CoV infection is primarily determined by the affinity between the viral RBD domain of spike protein and the host receptor ACE2, and there are some specific amino acid residues that are potentially involved in the interaction and viral binding (Huentelman et al., 2004; Wan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2005) . Recently, various computational studies using sequence alignment and phylogeny methods have reiteratively applied this prior structural knowledge on SARS CoV-ACE2 binding to map the similar residues at equivalent positions that are putatively involved in SARS CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction and the likely host range of SARSCoV-2 based on the properties of the conserved amino acids located in the biding interface (Othman et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2020) .",

Molecular dynamics simulations have been a pivotal approach to investigate mutation-induced changes in protein structure, function and molecular interaction at atomic scale (Dehury et al., 2015 (Dehury et al., , 2017 Pan et al., 2019 , Dehury et al., 2014 .

The sequence-structure alignment of the RBD regions in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was performed to identify the major similarities and differences between them ( Figure  1(A) ). Among the variable region, residues falling in beta sheets (b5-b9) exhibited maximum degree of divergence. The electrostatic surface potential of both the complexes displays striking resemblance in the charge distribution of amino acids at the receptor binding motif (Figure 1 (B)) in both the RBDs from SARS CoV-2 and SARS CoV. The overall Ca-of RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV revealed high conservation with RMSD value of 0.455 \u00c5, whereas the overall Ca-RMSD of whole ACE2-RBD protein complex is 0.458 \u00c5 which signifies that the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV binding fashion is quite similar (Figure 1(C) ). Sequence-structure analysis of the residues at the ACE2-RBD interface for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV were found to be conserved with least variation (Figure 1(A) ), and particularly, the hydrophobic residues known to be indispensable for interactions were highly conserved (Lan et al., 2020; Li et al., 2005) . The binding site residues responsible for interactions in both the RBDs are labelled in stars (Blue: SARS-CoV and Green: SARS-CoV-2) where majority of the amino acids are either are highly conserved or share similar side chain. The receptor-binding motif (RBM) of RBD prefers to binds to the external surface of the claw-like structure of ACE2 (Figure 1(C)) and share similar side chain properties with those in the SARS-CoV RBD. A number of natural mutations occur near RBM region of RBD spike protein widely termed as 'hot spots' as it is mainly responsible for viral-host binding, are presumed to determine the host range of SARS-CoV. In SARS-CoV several amino acids i.e. Asp442, Leu472, Asn479, Asp480, and Thr487 underwent natural selections, which are found to be critical for host receptor recognition, cell entry, and host range of SARS-CoV (Li, 2008; Wu et al., 2012) . Therefore, it is crucial to understand how mutation affects the strength of affinity of these complexes which will provide structural basis mediating SARS-Cov-2 entry into human cells.",

To understand the dynamic changes in the conformations of the wild type and mutant ACE2-RBD complexes, molecular dynamic simulation was carried out for 150 ns. The conformational changes observed during the 150 ns simulation for the ACE2-RBD complexes are discussed below. To determine the stability and mechanistic aspects of the wild type and mutant complexes, backbone RMSD and radius of gyration (R g ) of all systems were determined. RMSD is frequently used to depict the dynamic stability of systems as it measures the global fluctuations of proteins or complexes. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of backbone Ca atoms from the starting structures of production dynamics are computed and portrayed in Figure 3 (A). The RMSD of all starting configurations slightly increased during the initial equilibration phase but quickly converged after 10 ns ( Figure  3 (A)). Figure 3 (A) shows the backbone RMSD of the wild type and mutant systems ACE2-RBD complex over the entire 150 ns of MD simulations. The Wild type and Y505A system of the ACE2-RBD complex displayed lowest RMSD of 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 nm and 0.25 \u00b1 0.03 respectively, followed by Y449A, N487A, Y489 and N501A mutant systems. Among the mutants systems, N501A displayed higher RMSD of 0.33 \u00b1 0.09 nm as compared to the other complex systems. Overall most of the systems deviate to a quite similar small extent from their starting structures resulting in a backbone RMSD of $0.27 \u00b1 0.05 nm during 150 ns time scale of molecular dynamics simulations. The above data indicates that all of the systems reached equilibrium after few ns of equilibration. Comparing to the wild type 6M0J complex (solved at 2.45 \u00c5 resolution), the Ca-RMSD of representative structure of each systems were found to be 1.87, 1.68, 1.66, 2.66, 1.77 and 2.28 \u00c5 respectively for Wild type, Y449A, N487A, Y489A, N501A and Y505A systems indicates that complex systems maintained their structural integrity throughout MD simulation.",

The results are shown in Figure 3 for both ACE2 and RBD in wild type and mutant systems. Close observation of the RMSF plot analysis revealed that the conserved RBM (437-508 in SARS-Cov-2) is more flexible as compared to other regions of RBD. Among the most flexible regions we observed higher flexibility in the loop regions positioned at 472-490, and 495-506 near the binding site. In addition, we also observed that mutations have influence the RMSF of residues in the conserved regions of RBM. As compared to wild type (0.16 nm), the average RMSF values for the RBM site was computed to be 0.28, 0.18, 0.37, 0.40 and 0.13 nm respectively for the mutant Y449A, N487A, Y489A, N501A and Y505A systems respectively. The largest flexibility was seen at the characteristic inherent high fluctuating b-strand loop feature of RBM. It is well known fact the flexibility determines the binding as it may not only alter the binding interface between two interacting partners but also a vital contributor to the entropy penalty upon binding (Tuffery & Derreumaux, 2012) . Large-scale mobility in the binding site residues implies a greater magnitude of flexibility, therefore, it can be argued that mutation in the RBM motif distress the flexibility of this binding site which in turn affect the strength of binding of RBD to host receptor ACE2.",

To obtain the structural representative from each simulation systems, we performed ensemble RMSD based cluster analysis through a stringent cut-off of 0.15 nm. Based on the RMSD from structural ensembles, the representative snapshot was superimposed with the experimental ACE2-RBD complex (6M0J) (as shown in Figure 4 ) using PyMOL. As evidenced from Figure 4 , it can be clearly observed that the MD snapshots superpose well with the experiential complex with a Ca-RMSD < 2.5 \u00c5 which signifies that all systems retained the structural integrity and maintain the same fold with minor changes in the RBM of SARS-Cov-2. Essential dynamics of ACE2-RBD complex systems PCA or essential dynamics is one of the dimensionality reduction techniques, has been widely used to analyse molecular simulation data (Amadei et al., 1993; Kitao & Go, 1999) . It also allows identifying the dominant modes of molecular flexibility in a rigorous manner, and displays the information in the form of variations in the values of a small number of collective coordinates. In order to investigate the significant motions in wild type, Y449A, N487A, Y489A, N501A and Y505A ACE2-RBD complexes, PCA was carried out. The eigenvalues obtained from the diagonalization of the covariance matrix of the atomic fluctuations of each system has been displayed in Figure 5(A) . From the eigenvalue plot, it can be observed that five eigenvalues are relative to concerted motions rapidly declined in amplitude to reach a number of constrained, more localized fluctuations. PCA also suggested that first 20 principal components (PC) or EVs account for more than 87% of the total motions observed in the last 100 ns of the trajectories for ACE2-RBD complex systems. To know the global motion of these complexes (in phase space), we projected the first two EVs, EV1 and EV1 into the phase space. It can be seen from Figure 5 (B) that the properties of the motions described by the first two EVs are different in mutant systems as compared to the wild type ACE2-RBD complex. In all systems, we observed least differential scattering of main-chain atoms, which postulate the occurrence of least conformational changes in the mutant complexes as compared to wild type which is in agreement with RMSD analysis. Among the mutant systems, Y489A and N501A occupied more conformational space with high trace value (trace value of 108.07 and 104.57 nm 2 respectively) as compared wild type (trace value of 60.89 nm 2 ). These higher scattering of atoms with high trace values in the mutant systems indicates overall increased flexibility than the wild type which is in agreement with thermal-fluctuation. In order to find understand the movement of ACE2 and RBD in the wild type and mutant complexes motions described by EV1 and EV2, we plotted the porcupine plots (as show in in Figures 5(C-H) and S4). Interestingly, we consistently observed prominent in-ward motion of RDB towards the ACE2 binding interface in both wild type and mutant complexes. We speculate these consistent in-ward motion displayed by the RBD towards host receptor initiatives the molecular interaction, where mutations in the conserved region of RBM affects the dynamics of these systems. While, in ACE2 we also observed significant inward motions in Y449A, Y489A and Y505A systems towards the RBD (SARS-Cov-2).",

In addition, we also computed the electrostatic surface of representative structure of wild type and mutant type and compared with experimental complex (as shown in Figure S5 ). The SARS-CoV-2 RBM comprised of b5-b6 strands, a4-a5 helices and loops containing most of the contacting residues of SARS- CoV-2 for ACE2 binding in the wild type ACE2-RBD complex. The four pairs of i.e. Cys336-Cys361, Cys379-Cys432, Cys480-Cys488 and Cys391-Cys525 of disulfide bridges which stabilize the b-sheet structure were intact throughout MD. Comparative analysis of the MD simulated binding mode of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to the ACE2 was found to be more or less very similar to that of experimental SARS-CoV RBD-ACE2 complex structure (2AJF, Li et al., 2005) . Previous studies have also shown that a positive-charged patch on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD contributed by Lys417 which is absent on the SARS-CoV RBD may be contributing differentially to the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 (4.7 nM) and SARS-CoV (31 nM) to ACE2 receptor (Lan et al., 2020) . Along this line, we also monitored changes in electrostatic surface for mutant complexes which clearly displayed mutations affect the accessible surface area and charge distribution at RBM (Figures S5 and S6 ). Most importantly, our study identified mutation in the conserved RBM affects the distribution of charged residue at the binding interface which in turn contributes to the differential interaction of RBD with ACE2 receptor.",

Therefore, point mutation and subsequent MD simulation was focused on these residues. We first compared the experimental reference structure with the MD simulated systems and the retainment of strong hydrogen bonds observed for the aforementioned residues throughout the simulation analysis are in good agreement with the experimental data. However, such a stable interaction is not observed for the mutants with loss in strong Hydrogen bonds and binding affinity to the receptor (Table 3 ). In addition, we also measured the inter-atomic distance profile of the important interacting atom pairs (either hydrogen bond or electrostatic contact: for details see Table 3 ) of the RBD and ACE2 during the last 100 ns MD (Figure 7) . Our results show that mutation caused a significant decrease in binding interactions for five residues of the interface corresponding to RBM segment. This was corroborated by the binding affinity of the residues with receptor as calculated by PRODIGY, where mutation decreased the binding affinity of the vital residues.

The binding affinity of the spike protein and ACE2 was reported to be a chief factor for rate of replication and severity of the disease Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Therefore, to understand the binding affinity for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBD towards ACE2, we employed mCSM-PPI2 (Rodrigues et al., 2019) , an integrated bioinformatics tool to assess the effects of non-synonymous mutations in protein-protein affinity (DDG affinity ). The mCSM-PPI2 tool 3 . Important hydrogen-bonds interaction observed in the mutant systems (the cluster representative of each system was used to compute the hydrogen bonds using BIOVIA DSV). employs machine learning graph-based signature to predict the molecular effect of mutation in protein-protein binding affinity. Using both the experimental complexes of 2AJF (SARS-Cov-RBD-ACE2) and 6M0J (SARS-Cov-2-RBD-ACE2), saturation mutagenesis studies were performed to assess the effect of mutation on the interface residues of both the interacting partners (as summarized in Figures 9 and S7 ). All total 817 and 855 mutations were assessed for 2AJF and 6M0J complexes respectively. The average DDG affinity for all possible 19 mutations at the interface residues of 2AJF complex was computed to be \u00c00.65 kcal mol \u00c01 and for the 6M0J complex it was \u00c00.55 kcal mol \u00c01 , which indicates mutation tends to decrease the DDG affinity at the interface for both the complexes. In addition, we also computed the binding affinity of two complexes using PRODIGY (Xue et al., 2016) , a tool which uses contact-based prediction of binding affinity in protein-protein complexes (as summarized in Table  S3 ). We observed slightly higher binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2-RBD towards ACE2 protein as compared SARS-CoV-RBD which can be correlated with rate of infection and disease severity by SARS-CoV-2 strains Hoffmann et al., 2020) . Consensus, our modeling study using both the tools predicted, mutation in the RBM of RBD affects the binding affinity and provides some crucial information on how inter-residue non-covalent interaction is crucial for protein-protein interaction. Altogether our MD simulation and saturation mutagenesis study of the interfacing residues has provided new insights to complex virus-receptor interactions which provide better avenues to understand SARS-CoV-2 disease biology. A series of structural studies on SARS-CoV have revealed that that receptor recognition by SARS-CoV is one of the utmost significant elements of its cross-species and human-to-human transmissions (Li et al., 2006 and Li, 2013) . In this illustration, using experimental solved SARS CoV-2 RBD-ACE2 complex, multi-scale molecular dynamics and saturation mutagenesis were conducted to understand the host-virus interactions at atomic scale. The result from our study strongly supports how binding affinity between host cell receptor and virus spike protein is essential for infection and also provides some useful insights to the disease severity. The present study will certainly be useful as a framework to undertake further structure-based study on other hosts ACE2 receptors to provide novel insights into the host receptor-SARS CoV-2 RBD mediated interactions that may help to battle this novel COVID-19 outbreak.",

However, the molecular mechanisms of recognition and role of conserved amino acids at the RBM of RBD from SARS-CoV-2 binding to human ACE2 are under explored. In this study, we have comprehensively explored the wild type ACE2-RBD complex as well as five randomly selected mutants complexes (located in the conserved and variable sites of RBM of SARS-CoV-2) through all-atoms MD simulations.",

Hence, further studies are needed to understand the ACE2-RBD complex interactions at different temperature, which can provide crucial link of its infection ability at different temperature zones across the globe to formulate intervention therapeutic strategies for preventing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 in near future.",
