            "text": "Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are widely used in low-cost photogrammetry. Even small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can deliver valuable data for the inventory of inaccessible and dangerous areas or objects. The acquisition of data for 3D object modeling is a complicated, time-consuming, and cost-intensive process. It requires the use of expensive equipment and often manual work as well as professional software. These are major barriers limiting the development of modern tourist platforms that promote local attractions. Information technologies offer new opportunities for the development of the services market, including the development of smart tourism services, as an integral part of the smart city concept. 3D models are an important element of this process as they form the basis for the use of new visualization technologies, such as Virtual, Mixed, and Augmented Reality (VR/MR/AR). 3D modeling provides a new opportunity to use AR/MR technology to present information about objects, virtual tours of the historic buildings, and their promotion. It also creates an opportunity to preserve the architectural heritage and preventive maintenance of buildings. Despite the increasing use of new measuring platforms and computer modeling techniques, the implementation of 3D building models in smart tourism services is still limited, focusing more on the results of scientific projects rather than on the implementation of the new ones. The paper presents an universal methodology for the inventory of historical buildings using low-cost UAVs. It describes the most important aspects related to the process of planning UAV measurement missions and photogrammetric data acquisition. The construction of 3D models and the possibilities of their further use to build smart tourism services based on Web/AR/MR/VR technology was also presented.",

Even small UAVs can deliver valuable data for the inventory of inaccessible and dangerous areas or objects. Figure 2 presents the proposed methodology that describes the use of UAVs and ground images from Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras for preparing a 3D textured model for AR/VR purposes. Typically, after processing the UAV/DSLR raw data dense point cloud is generated. Based on this cloud, wireframes are generated and then using parametric modeling or NURBS curves, BIM models are created. In the proposed approach, we suggest unstructured geometric reconstruction of the external surface of the building based on point cloud. The created model is then optimized in subsequent steps for use in AR and VR mobile applications. ",

This functionality allows simplifying even complex models to fit within the available mobile or AR/MR device resources. A common rule is to balance the number of triangles in order to maintain the highest quality of objects. To create a model with proper mesh construction, a very high-density model is generated and the number of tris (triangles) in the model is reduced so that they run smoothly on their respective applications.",

Five derivative models were built on the basis of this model, 2 for desktop devices for VR, WebGIS, and 3 for mobile devices and network operation. After reviewing the documentation, we decided to adopt the following limits for the number of polygons (triangles)-10 M, 3.5 M, 1 M, 250 K, 100 K, 25 K ( Table 4 ). The main goal was to reduce the impact of 3D objects on performance by adapting to the device performance and the selected software architecture (local/network). Firstly, the reference model, as the most accurate version of the model (high-quality model) was prepared. Secondly for scenarios with models stored locally on desktop devices and visualized directly on the client, medium and low-quality models were constructed. The last three models assume a network version with multiple users to share a model on a server for collaborative viewing. The preparation workflow for 3D models is presented in Figure 11 . Initially, the reference model was generated using Agisoft Metachape software. In the following step, Metashape application was used to decimating the model in order to reduce the number of vertices of the model. According to the above assumptions, five models were created from the presented workflow. Based on high-poly model a Normal map was generated. Then the texture of the model was transferred from the high-poly model to the low-poly one. In the next step a diffuse map was generated using the previously created normal map. In the last step the mesh is generated and adjusted with the use of UV mapping mode. Finally, the mesh is imported into Blender in order to adjust its position and scale for use in the Unity game engine.",

For web apps, this number should be less than 250,000, and for desktop apps up to 2,500,000 for the whole scene. The number of calls drawn is often more limiting than the total number of polygons. It is beneficial to present one or more complex meshes than too many separate, less complicated models.",

It changes classical storytelling methods and combines them with new technology, especially data visualization methods (3D Web/AR/MR). It reviewed the digital documentation of heritage using low-cost UAV, TLS, LIDAR 3D parametric HBIM models of heritage buildings. The proposed framework was implemented in the Modlin water tower, located near a unique military complex near the Vistula and Narew rivers in Poland. The procedure for heritage digital documentation consists of three tiers: (1) Collecting Raw data using UAV and TLS, (2) Process acquired data and prepare point clouds, and (3) Generate the parametric model. AgiSoft Metashape was used to help in tracing the as-built point cloud data captured by the laser scanner. The workflow provides new tools and methods for 3D virtual heritage modeling, documentation, management, and analysis.",
