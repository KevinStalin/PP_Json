The WHO has officially named the pathogen as 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)'. SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the respiratory system, but may also affect multiple other organs including digestive, cardiovascular, haematological, urinary and neurological systems. The WHO has since declared the pandemic as COVID-19. In view of its high transmissibility, general susceptibility and lack of targeted treatment, the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China announced that COVID-19 is to be added to the 'Law of the People's Republic of China on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases' as Class B infectious disease and shall be managed as Class A infectious disease on 20 January 2020.",

The middle-aged and elderly population with high incidence of cerebrovascular and chronic diseases are also at high risk of getting COVID-19 and often severe. Some patients with COVID-19 may show neurological symptoms in the early stage, while symptoms of pneumonia such as fever and dry cough are mild or even asymptomatic, which can be easily misdiagnosed. Therefore, even strict screening is done before admission, it is impossible to completely avoid inadvertent transmission and nosocomial infection of a patient with atypical COVID-19 to a ward. Nosocomial infection is an infection transmitted by healthcare personnel. When prevention is inadequate, the rate of nosocomial infection can reach 41%. 1 The neurological intensive care unit (NCU) is a closed environment and has a high proportion of critically ill patients with open airways; therefore, the risk of nosocomial infections is significantly higher. It is essential to effectively identify patients with COVID-19 and implement steps to protect the safety of medical staff and other hospitalised patients.",

It is not recommended to administer three or more antibiotics at the same time, and the course of each medication should be less than 10 days. A phase III randomised double-blind clinical trial of remdesivir is currently underway. The preliminary report of compassionate-use remdesivir showed clinical improvement rate of 68%. 6 For severe or critically ill patients, clinicians should pay attention to the prevention of complications, secondary infections, and provide organ supportive therapy when needed, such as continuous renal replacement therapy and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 7 Severe patients can be on short-term glucocorticoids, although currently there is no general agreement of usage.

This population is also a high-risk group for cerebrovascular disease. The abnormal increase of D-dimer in critically ill COVID-19 patients is not uncommon, which greatly increases the probability of embolic vascular events. It has been suggested that early application of anticoagulant therapy can be used in patients with severe COVID-19 to improve outcome; however, no specific inclusion or exclusion criteria have been pointed out so far. 8 Clinically, patients with COVID-19 can concurrently have acute ischaemic stroke. 9 SARS-CoV-2 can bind to the ACE2 receptor of vascular endothelial cells, 10 resulting in abnormally increased blood pressure in hypertensive patients, increasing the risk of intracranial haemorrhage. In addition, patients with severe COVID-19 often have thrombocytopenia, which may increase their risk of developing intracerebral haemorrhage. The NCU is an enclosed environment. Many critically ill patients have open airways that can produce high density of the formed droplets/aerosol per unit volume in the air. Many NCU patients are in the state of either unconsciousness or paralysed with compromised immunity. They are prone to nosocomial infections from multidrug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, due to coma and encephalopathy or aphasia, patients cannot describe their symptoms during sickness, making it more difficult to distinguish between aspiration pneumonia and COVID-19. Once a case of COVID-19 appears in the NCU, serious transmission will happen if the protective measures are not in place.",

The stroke centre green pathway is designed to promote timely treatment, enhance quality of care and optimise patient outcomes for patients who suffered acute stroke.
