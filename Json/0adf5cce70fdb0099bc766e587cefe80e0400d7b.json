Based on the observed impact of NP 219 specimen quality, we estimate that the reduction of quality NP specimen collection that results in 220 \u03b2-actin Ct increasing from 28 to 32 (roughly 25% to 75% percentile) decreases the absolute 221 probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection by 5.4% (95%CI 2.7% to 8.2%).

First, the correlation between \u03b2-actin Ct and SARS-CoV-2 suggests that 223 quantitative interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 human specimens may be enhanced by adjusting for 224 the \u03b2-actin Ct. Second, the data support the concern that poor specimen collection may 225 contribute to false-negative results. The concern of false-negative NP SARS-CoV-2 testing has 226 led to the recommendation to retest patients with moderate to high clinical suspicion of COVID-227 19 (29, 30).
