We summarize a survey executed in a sample of the population (n = 1000) in Flanders, Belgium, in which we investigated support for using these broader criteria to evaluate vaccines for funding decisions. By means of both favourable and unfavourable framings of a hypothetical vaccine across 40 value dimensions, we find support for the view that people indeed consider a broad range of medical and socio-economic criteria relevant. Several of these are not incorporated in standard evaluation frameworks for vaccines. The different results we find for different framings highlight the importance of developing a consistent a priori value framework for vaccine evaluation, rather than evaluating vaccines on an ad hoc basis.",

However, as vaccine schedules cannot become overcrowded and budgets are finite, priority-setting between these vaccines is an inevitable reality of policy-making. To assist governments in making these difficult but inevitable choices, various decision-aid frameworks have been developed. These frameworks can be broadly categorized into two groups. On the one hand there are deliberative frameworks in which a structured set of general evaluation principles are defined for vaccines [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Examples of this deliberative approach were developed in 2014 by the WHO or in 2010 by the Health Council of the Netherlands. In the WHO framework, vaccines are evaluated based on the medical burden of the disease (its clinical aspects as well as its perception and alignment with national health policy goals), the performance, availability and economic impact of the vaccine and the impact of the vaccination program on the healthcare system (e.g., in terms of operational challenges) [3] . In the Dutch example a vaccine is evaluated on five dimensions: severity and size of the disease",

As the particular framing of the value proposition can affect people's judgment [28] , we decided to present criteria in two ways: through a favourable and an unfavourable framing. In the favourable version, the vaccine under evaluation scored well on the particular criterion. If this specific dimension is deemed relevant, then the vaccine would become more attractive for funding. In the unfavourable version, the vaccine scored poorly on the particular criterion. When the criterion is considered relevant, it becomes less attractive for funding. Both framings are important to understand the relevance of an overarching criterion. For example, the \"vaccine safety\" dimension could be deemed extremely important to guide decisions in case a vaccine induces a risk of serious side effects. But when a vaccine has no side effects at all, people might consider safety more self-evident and attribute lower importance to a vaccine's safety profile. Table 1 shows all statements in their two formulations. We chose a \"between subjects\" design: each respondent evaluated either only 40 favourable or 40 unfavourable framings. All 40 statements were presented in random order to each respondent to avoid any order effects. Table 1 . Value propositions, favourably and unfavourably framed.",

            "text": "Via a market research agency (Research Now SSI-RN SSI) we collected two quasi-representative samples of 500 respondents, one for the favourable set of value propositions and one for the unfavourable one. Initially a stratified random sample of in total 1580 respondents was recruited from an online panel of 250,000 Flemish members (4% of the population), based on quotas for the Flemish population for the characteristics gender, age, educational level and geographical spread. Panel members received small incentives for participating in the research (e.g., vouchers). All these respondents completed our survey. The research agency then applied strict criteria and implemented tests to guarantee high data quality for our final sample. First, it excluded all \"speedsters\" (respondents who finish the survey in less than a third of the median time to complete the survey for the entire sample) and \"straight-liners\" (respondents who consistently give the same answer throughout the entire survey). Second, a test was added to the survey to be able to exclude those respondents who gave thoughtless answers. Two of the value propositions were repeated throughout the survey (so respondents completed 42 rating exercises in total). When there was more than 2 points difference between the scores given to both pairs of value propositions, respondents were automatically excluded from the final sample. For example, a score of 5/10 and 9/10 on one of the two repeated value propositions, and one of 5/10 and 8/10 on the other, led to automatic exclusion of the respondent. In total 580 respondents were excluded, leading to 1000 survey responses that were considered sufficiently valid and reliable for our analysis. Sample size calculation for comparing the means of two groups showed that a sample size of 500 respondents per group was more than sufficient to find significant differences of 0.5 in the mean respondent scores with a 95% power. Table 2 lists the main demographic characteristics of the included respondents. 3. Results Figure 1 shows boxplots with the distributions of the respondent scores across the sample for the favourable and unfavourable statements. The asterisks on the boxplots denote the averages. Three overall observations can be made. First, none of the 40 dimensions was dismissed as completely irrelevant by our sample, i.e., obtaining an average score below 5 in both positive and negative framings. The average of the positive items ranged from 5.9 (for the anti-vaccination proposition) to 7.9 (for the mortality proposition). The average of the negative items ranged from 4.8 (for the anti-vaccination proposition) to 7.3 (for the severe side-effects proposition). Only the negatively phrased anti-vaccination proposition had an average relevance score below 5. This indicates that our sample considers a broad range of criteria relevant to evaluate vaccines.

The most relevant aspects were vaccine effectiveness, mortality risk, eradication potential, transmissibility, prevention alternatives, scientific certainty, severity of symptoms, duration of symptoms, cost disease (private), availability of treatment, caregiver impact, severe side-effects of the vaccine and whether the disease affects babies. The least relevant dimensions were whether the disease mainly affects migrants or LGBT members, legal liability for the state, impact on the country's image and response by anti-vaccination groups.",
