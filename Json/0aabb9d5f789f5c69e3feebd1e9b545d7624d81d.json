            "text": "In response to the ongoing global pandemic, progress has been made in understanding the molecular-level host interactions 9 of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for COVID-19. However, when the virus enters the body it interacts not 10 only with the host but also with the micro-organisms already inhabiting the host. Understanding the virus-host-microbiome 11 interactions can yield additional insights into the biological processes perturbed by viral invasion. With this aim we carry out a 12 functional analysis of previously published RNA sequencing data of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from eight COVID-19 patients, 13 twenty-five community-acquired pneumonia patients, and twenty healthy controls. The resulting microbiome functional profiles 14 and their top differentiating features clearly separate the cohorts. By examining the functional features in connection with their 15 associated metabolic pathways, differentially abundant pathways are indicated, compared to both the community-acquired 16 pneumonia and healthy cohorts. From this analysis, distinguishing signatures in COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes are 17 identified, including decreased lipid and glycan metabolism pathways, and increased carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Here 18 we present a framework for comparative functional analysis of microbiomes, the results from which can lead to new hypotheses 19 on the host-microbiome interactions in healthy versus afflicted cohorts. The findings from this analysis call for further research 20 on microbial functions and host-microbiome interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection. 21 Introduction 22 An impressive number of scientific studies have rapidly been published on the genomics and molecular-level host interactions 23 of the new coronavirus SARS-Cov-2 1 of reported bat origin, 2 responsible for the COVID-19 disease pandemic. Additionally, 24 understanding changes in the microenvironment within the host can yield insights into related biological processes perturbed 25 by the virus.

While the examined 44 features were selected as those differentiating 63 COVID-19 from CAP and healthy controls, they also separate the healthy control samples from all others; the healthy controls 64 cluster tightly together. The results also demonstrate that the samples do not merely cluster by the total number of input reads or 65 the fraction of functionally annotated microbial reads, since those measures vary within cohorts (Supplementary Fig. S1 ).

The comparative approach 101 taken here aims to mitigate possible experimental variation and resulting biases within individual samples, by focusing on 102 detecting robust and consistent differences in the detected microbial functions. The framework presented here includes 103 read filtering, functional annotation with a protein domain database and enzyme hierachy, feature abundance projection to 104 a comparable scale, and finally metabolic pathway scoring to indicate differentially abundant functionalities in COVID-19 105 microbiomes compared to healthy and CAP samples. As a result, we identified both enzyme code features and metabolic 106 pathways that differentiate COVID-19 respiratory tract microbiomes. The resulting functional profiles distinguish COVID-19 107 samples from others, similarly to the original taxonomy-based analysis of the community members. 5 108",
