            "text": "To address this question, we performed a retrospective cohort study of the first 100 patients admitted to the Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) for COVID-19 infection. We hypothesized that inflammatory biomarker profiles would stratify patients into three cohorts: (1) stable and non-intubated throughout their hospital admission (\"mild\"); (2) initially stable and nonintubated but then had respiratory deterioration requiring intubation or high-flow nasal cannula later in their hospital course (\"progressive\"); and (3) patients who were unstable and required intubation within 12 hours of admission (\"severe\"). Among patients who were stable and did not require intubation at admission, elevated CRP values at admission were associated with progressive respiratory failure later during their hospital course. CRP level at admission correlated with physiological measures of disease severity (SOFA score, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and with the inflammatory cytokine IL-6. However, the significant overlap in admission CRP values between \"mild\" and \"progressive\" patient sub-cohorts would limit the practical utility of initial CRP values for clinical care decisions. Remarkably, we found that a rise in CRP values over the first 48-72 hours of hospital admission distinguished patients that would develop progressive respiratory failure from patients that would remain stable throughout their hospital course. First, we show that the CRP trend is a clinically predictive tool and can be superior to a physiological index such as the ROX index. Second, since CRP is down-stream to several immune pathways including IL-6, our results suggest that these pathways are dynamic early in hospital admission and precede respiratory deterioration. Our work suggests that close, serial monitoring of early CRP values may aid clinical prognostication and consideration of immunomodulatory therapy in COVID-19 patients.",

Thereafter, 100 patients remained for evaluation. Prior studies typically stratify COVID-19 patients into either \"noncritical\" or \"critical\" categories and do not distinguish patients that were critically ill at admission versus those patients that initially had non-critical illness and then deteriorated. Given the clinical importance of predicting which non-critically patients would remain stable and which non-critically patients would later deteriorate, we divided our cohort into three categories. (1) \"Mild\" patients were stable patients who remained on room air or supplemental oxygen (via lowflow nasal cannula or face mask) throughout their hospital course and never required intubation or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC). (2) \"Progressive\" patients were initially stable on room air, low-flow nasal cannula or face mask but then deteriorated and required intubation and mechanical ventilation or HFNC. (3) \"Severe\" patients required intubation or HFNC within 12 hours of admission.",

The factors that distinguish patients that remain stable from patients that are initially stable but then deteriorate are poorly characterized. We classified COVID-19 inpatients into three cohorts according to the stability and severity of their respiratory failure: 1) \"Mild\" (remained on room air or supplemental oxygen); 2) \"Progressive\" (initially on room air or supplemental oxygen then later required intubation or high-flow nasal cannula); or 3) \"Severe\" (required intubation within 12 hours of admission) ( Figure S1 and Table   1 ). Initial levels of CRP, D-dimer, procalcitonin, and IL-6 were elevated in patients with progressive disease compared with mild disease (112. 5 [63.4-198 There are a number of tools used to assess clinical condition. Perhaps the most commonly used is the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, which is a measure of organ dysfunction with higher scores representing worsening organ damage. Respiratory function is assessed as a subscore of this system and is based on the ratio of the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO 2 or P/F ratio). 10 Lower P/F ratios indicate worsening hypoxemia. Patients with progressive disease presented with a higher SOFA score than those with mild disease, although there was significant overlap (3 [2-3.5] vs. 1 [0. , P = 0.01) ( Figure 2A ). Additionally, as expected given our classification criteria, admission respiratory SOFA score ( Figure 2B ) and P/F ratios (Table 1) were not significantly different between progressive patients and mild patients. At admission, CRP and D-dimer were clinically relevant as they were correlated with measures of organ and respiratory function. Both CRP levels and D-dimer levels showed a strong positive association with SOFA score (\u03c1 = 0.41, P < 0.001; \u03c1 = 0.47, P < 0.001, respectively) ( Figures 2C and S3A ). Moreover, these levels were inversely correlated to P/F ratio on admission (\u03c1 = -0.54, P < 0.001; \u03c1 = -0.23, P = 0.02, respectively), demonstrating an association of these markers with the severity of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure ( Figures 2D and S3B ). Among patients that were intubated, CRP values at the time of intubation showed some correlation with the P/F ratio at the time of intubation, though it was not statistically significant ( Figure S3C ).",

            "text": "The association of CRP to respiratory deterioration and physiological measures of disease severity was particularly intriguing, as CRP levels can have mechanistic implications. CRP levels are tracked in a wide range of inflammatory diseases and are linked to IL-6 signaling, which has been a therapeutic target in COVID-19. Indeed, IL-6 levels did show a striking J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f correlation to CRP ( Figure S3D ) and P/F ratio ( Figure S3E ). However, the number of patients with IL-6 levels were limited, as this institution's clinical guidelines did not endorse routine clinical measurement of IL-6 because results took over 48 hours to return. In many institutions, CRP levels result within several hours and can capture rapidly evolving clinical courses that cytokine assays, which take more than 1-2 days, cannot. These results supported the further investigation of CRP as a biomarker with mechanistic implications and potential practical clinical utility. (Figures 3B and 3C and Tables S3 and S4 ). In all patients, CRP levels peaked early within approximately 10 days of symptom onset ( Figure 3C ). The longitudinal CRP trend of progressive patients closely resembled that of severe patients, with a sharp, early rise in CRP ( Figure 3B ). In contrast, mild patients (who remained non-critically ill) had a lower plateau and then a steady decline in CRP ( Figure 3B ). Further quantification revealed that the change in CRP over the time course less than 72 hours of admission was significantly different between mild and progressive patients (P = 0.009), whereas it was similar between progressive and severe patients (P = 0.81) ( Figure 3D ). This indicates that progressive patients when compared to mild patients had a more rapid rise in CRP levels drawn at 24-48 hours and 48-72 hours after admission, (182.0 \u00b1 101 vs. 97.6 \u00b1 72 mg/L, P = 0.006; 190.1 \u00b1 99 vs. 90.2 \u00b1 64 mg/L, P < 0.001, respectively) ( Figure 3D ). The odds ratio of requiring advanced respiratory support was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 16.9 [95%CI: 1.96-145.3] (P = 0.01) when CRP value of greater than 300 mg/L (upper limit of the assay at our institution) was achieved within 72 hours of admission.",

            "text": "We tested the prognostic utility of CRP levels in determining the need for advanced respiratory support in COVID-19 patients, using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses incorporating patients with mild vs. progressive disease. In particular, we first compared with predictive value of admission CRP levels (day 0 CRP) and change in CRP from day 0 to day 1 ( (Table S2) . We demonstrated the predictive value of both CRP levels and ROX index to predict respiratory deterioration during hospitalization. Further, we showed that the change in CRP had superior predictive value to either initial CRP value alone or the ROX index. CRP, D-dimer, and procalcitonin levels at admission were increased in the progressive cohort, compared to mild (i.e., stable). At the same time, we found that CRP did have a remarkably close association with the degree of respiratory failure as the correlation of CRP to P/F ratio was highly significant. While significantly different, these tests would have limited prognostic utility for frontline clinicians, as there was a high degree of overlap between mild and progressive cohorts that precluded a simple threshold value. To address this clinical challenge, we noted that maximum CRP distinguished stably non-critical (mild cohort) patients from those with progression of respiratory failure. This finding suggested that CRP values are dynamic in COVID-19 patients that develop later respiratory failure. Similar results were reported indicating the utility of maximal CRP for the need of mechanical ventilation. 13 However, the maximal CRP is not useful as a clinical decision-making tool because the determination whether the CRP value is at the maximum is only made retrospectively. We did find that a rapid rise in CRP preceded and associated with respiratory deterioration among patients that were stable at admission. By tracking CRP values longitudinally during hospitalization, we found that CRP J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f levels rose more precipitously in the first 3 days after hospital admission in the progressive cohort compared to the mild cohort, with an appreciable elevation detectable as early as 24 to 48 hours after admission. Thus, the rate of change of CRP, rather than the absolute value of admission values, were more closely associated with clinical deterioration. Initial absolute values of CRP were similar between mild and progressive patients, but the dynamic trends of CRP were similar between progressive and severe patients. Another study also found limited prognostic utility for admission CRP values and required a 10 variable risk score to predict clinical deterioration. 14 Our study suggests that examination of dynamic trends, rather that absolute value at admission, can lead to strong associations with prognosis despite only using a single laboratory value. We confirmed that change in CRP had clinical utility in predicting intubation as shown in our ROC analyses where utilizing change in CRP resulted in a higher AUC than the ROX index, a clinically validated index used to predict intubation. Similar to our results, a high CRP cutoff for a single-value CRP was reported. 15 This high CRP cutoff selects for an extremely ill patient population and leads to high specificity and low sensitivity, which make it unhelpful as clinical predictors. In contrast, while the AUC value for \u2206CRP was not dramatically higher than that of ROX or admission CRP, the high sensitivity for respiratory decompensation makes it a much more valuable screening test. Our study suggests that trending CRP, a highly accessible tool for frontline clinicians compared to complicated scoring systems, has predictive value for respiratory failure among initially non-critically ill patients on the general medical floor.",

            "text": "While our study has implications for clinical prognostication, our result also may suggest underlying pathological mechanisms and possible strategies for therapeutic intervention. As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection, 16, 17 several proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-10, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f IL-2, and IFN-gamma) are increased in COVID-19. 12, [18] [19] [20] [21] We demonstrate a correlation between the CRP and D-dimer inflammatory biomarkers with disease severity and a particularly close association of CRP with hypoxemic respiratory failure (P/F ratio). Our study highlights the potential role of IL-6, which is upstream of increased CRP. In our cohort analysis, IL-6 levels showed a positive correlation with CRP in patients who had IL-6 levels drawn, and patients treated with tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, had rapid and sustained decrease in CRP levels (N=15, Figure S4 ). Our study suggests that increased CRP rise, and by virtue presumed elevation of IL-6, in the first 24-48 hours may be of critical importance to disease progression; no other study is focused only on this hyper-acute period. Furthermore, in many studies, COVID-19 patients are simply categorized as non-critically ill (\"floor\") or critically ill (\"ICU\"), 8 as in a longitudinal study of lymphocyte subsets and cytokines 8 or single-cell RNAsequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage. 22 Our results may suggest that \"critically ill\" COVID-19 patients should be sub-divided into two sub-cohorts as patients that developed a requirement for advanced oxygen support later in their hospital course (\"progressive\") had a distinct inflammatory biomarker profile than patients who required immediate intubation on hospital admission (\"severe\"). Multiple RCTs are examining tocilizumab in COVID-19 infection, 23-27 and preliminary results from recent phase III studies have been mixed. The COVACTA trial evaluating tocilizumab (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, press release: https://www.roche.com/investors/updates/inv-update-2020-07-29.htm) and another trial centered on sarilumab (Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, press release: https://www.sanofi.com/en/media-room/press-releases/2020/2020-07-02-22-30-00), did not meet primary endpoints. However, the EMPACTA trial (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, press release: https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2020-09-18.htm) did show that tocilizumab reduced likelihood of progression to mechanical ventilation. Our work may suggest J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 13 that there is value in delineating the particular \"progressive\" patients whose uptrend in CRP may suggest that they could be particularly poised to benefit from this type of IL-6 directed therapy.",

This study highlights that the dynamic nature of the inflammation in COVID-19 is key and directly associated to physiological parameters. The key limitations of this work are its single-center and retrospective design. Future prospective studies could study a wider range of cytokines and chemokines along with the interaction of CRP rise and immunomodulatory treatment. In conclusion, we suggest that closely tracking the levels of CRP in the hyper-acute phase of admission for COVID-19 patients is a valuable tool to stratify the risk that a patient will have progressive hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring intubation. This metric is feasible for frontline clinicians in the emergency department observation units or medical floor inpatient wards.",

A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined by a positive result on a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of SARS-CoV-2. Patients were excluded if they were not initially admitted due to COVID-19, deemed to have had a false positive result, or transferred from a non-affiliated hospital later than 48 hours after their initial admission (Figure S1). Patient charts were last reviewed to the end of the hospitalization, allowing follow-up until hospital discharge for all patients. Any information from subsequent clinic visits or hospitalizations was not incorporated into the chart review. This study was approved by the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board (Protocol 2020P001139). Optout consent was selected in this study.Patients were classified using 2 different classifications. In the first classification scheme, patients were designated either as \"Floor\" patients (requiring only floor-level care throughout their hospitalization) or \"ICU\" patients (required care in the ICU at any point during hospitalization). With a specific interest in COVID-19 patients whose respiratory conditions would deteriorate after admission, inpatients were divided according to a second classification system: \"mild, progressive, and severe\". Those with \"Mild\" disease maintained adequate oxygenation with room air or oxygen supplementation with nasal cannula or face mask throughout the entire course of their hospitalization. On the other end, the \"Severe\" group included patients who required advanced respiratory support, including mechanical ventilation or high-flow nasal cannula, within 12 hours of admission, with the admission time being defined J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f as the time that the first vitals were recorded for the patient. Patients categorized as having \"Progressive\" disease were initially admitted to the hospital on room air or oxygen supplementation with nasal cannula or face mask but required advanced respiratory support due to respiratory deterioration later during the hospital course at least 12 hours after admission.Data CollectionData were retrospectively collected by reviewing electronic medical records. Patient demographic data included age, gender, race or ethnicity, past medical history, use of immunosuppressive medication or chemotherapy, and history of smoking. Clinical information included date of first symptom, first positive SARS-CoV-2 result, admission, intubation, extubation, and discharge; admission ward (ICU or non-critically ill medical floor); requirement for oxygen, vasopressors, and intubation or high-flow nasal cannula; respiratory rate; amount of oxygen requirement at admission; the maximum amount of oxygen requirement; sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score upon admission; respiratory rate and oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) on the day of admission (day 0) and day 1; administration of hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, or clinical trial agent composed of remdesivir or placebo; and survival status. Partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO 2 ) or oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) upon admission as well as immediately following intubation was obtained. For patients in whom an arterial gas analysis was not tested and was not intubated upon admission, PaO 2 value was imputed using a non-linear method,31 and FiO 2 was calculated using a formula of FiO 2 = 0.20 + oxygen flow rate (L/min) * 0.04. Then, PaO 2 /FiO 2 (P/F) ratio was calculated using these values. ROX index is a prediction tool developed to identify the need for mechanical ventilation in pneumonia patients treated with high-flow nasal cannula.31 We calculated ROX index in COVID-19 patients independent of the high-flow nasal cannula treatment. ROX index J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f on Day 0 (the day of admission) and day 1 were calculated using a formula of ROX Index = SpO\u2082 / FiO\u2082 / respiratory rate (breaths/min). Laboratory test results collected upon admission included: C-reactive protein, serum ferritin, D-dimer, and procalcitonin. Additionally, maximum serum ferritin value during the hospital course, C-reactive protein values during admission, and the first three interleukin (IL)-6 levels drawn after admission were obtained.",

The mixed effects model with Sidak's multiple comparison was used for the analysis of repeated measures. The tests used are designated in the figure legends.Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to estimate the prognostic performance of the following parameters to predict the need for aggressive respiratory support including intubation and high-flow nasal cannula: day 0 CRP, defined as the first CRP drawn less than 24 hours after admission; \u2206CRP, defined as the change in CRP from less than 24 hours after admission to the CRP 24-48 hours after admission; day 0 ROX index, which was the ROX index using the first vital signs after admission; and day 1 ROX index, which was the ROX index using the morning vital signs on day 1. CRP values exceeding the upper limit of assay (300 mg/L) were imputed as the maximum value of the assay (300 mg/L) in the ROC analysis of day 0 CRP. In the ROC analysis for \u2206CRP, only patients in whom the \u2206CRP values before intubation could be calculated were included. In particular, patients who were intubated before the second CRP measurement or whose CRP values exceeded the upper limit of assay were excluded. For the ROC analyses of ROX indices, all patients in whom the ROX index was able to be calculated were included. The area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence interval and the optimal cutoff value determined by Youden's J static with corresponding sensitivity and specificity calculated. A multivariate regression model was used to assess the association between day 0 CPR and \u2206CRP and the need for advanced respiratory support. Variables that showed P value of less than 0.1 with univariate regression analysis were selected as covariates for the adjustment in the multivariate regression model. Of the potential confounders including age, chronic lung disease, severe cardiac disease, cancer history, and smoking history, the covariates included in the multivariate regression model were age and severe cardiac condition.",
