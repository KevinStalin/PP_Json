The final diagnosis was that of pulmonary embolism complicated by cavitating pulmonary infarction and subsequent hemopneumothorax[4]. The role of anticoagulant therapy in the aetiopathogenesis of hemopneumothorax was exemplified by an 81 year old ex-smoker with documented bullous emphysema. He had been admitted to hospital with a provisional diagnosis of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and unstable angina. His initial management included noninvasive positive pressure ventilation subcutaneous enoxaparin, and aspirin 81 mg/day. Subsequently, he experienced an episode of hemoptysis, followed by increasing breathlessness. Chest radiography was consistent with",
