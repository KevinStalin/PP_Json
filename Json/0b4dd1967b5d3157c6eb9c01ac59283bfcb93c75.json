as a pandemic threat affecting over 2 million people. The infectious process initiates via binding of SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) glycoprotein to host Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The interaction is mediated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S glycoprotein, promoting host receptor recognition and binding to ACE2 peptidase domain (PD), thus representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Herein, we present a computational study aimed at identifying small molecules potentially able to target RBD. Although targeting PPI remains a challenge in drug discovery, our investigation highlights that interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 PD might be prone to small molecule modulation, due to the hydrophilic nature of the bi-molecular recognition process and the presence of druggable hot spots. The fundamental objective is to identify, and provide to the international scientific community, hit molecules potentially suitable to enter the drug discovery process, preclinical validation and development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The end of the year 2019 has been marked as a critical period for the humankind history, due to the epidemic spreading of virustransmitted flu. In December 2019, first cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, were detected and the related infection rapidly spread out all over the world [1] . Due to a very high rate of virulence associated to morbidity and mortality (330 infected people and 22.9 deaths per million inhabitants) [2] affecting the global population in 210 countries, in March 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) stated COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a pandemic, representing a health emergency of international concern [3, 4] . Since the beginning of 21 st century, coronaviruses caused disease outbreaks: SARS-CoV emerged in Guangdong (China) in 2002 [5, 6] , while during the 2012 MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) affected the Arabian Peninsula [7, 8] . These viruses initially were of a zoonotic nature but over the years they crossed the species barrier through bats, in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dromedary camels for MERS [9] [10] [11] . Coronaviruses are classified in four genera, with both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belonging to b-CoV genus [12] . On the basis of sequence alignments, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 seemed strongly correlated, sharing about 76% of sequence identity. These are positive-strand RNA viruses containing a membrane covered from Spike (S) glycoprotein that provides their characteristic crown aspect [13] . The interaction with the host cell is promoted by the S glycoprotein, that mediates receptor recognition and membrane fusion [14, 15] . S protein is composed of two functional subunits S1 and S2, which remain noncovalently bound in the pre-fusion state. S1 contains the receptorbinding domain (RBD) also referred as domain B, involved in the binding with the host cell receptor; while S2 contains the fusion machinery and is responsible for membrane fusion. During the viral infection, when S1 binds the host cell receptor, the S protein is cleaved at the boundary site, between S1 and S2 subunits (S1-S2 cleavage site), converting to the post-fusion conformation. This first event promotes a second cleavage by the host protease at a different cleavage site, leading conformational changes in S2 and enabling membrane fusion [16] [17] [18] . The receptor-binding and proteolytic events act in synergy to induce the conformational changes and thus helping the coronavirus to enter the host cell [19] . In humans, the first entry step for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV life cycles is mediated by the interaction with Angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a protein mainly expressed in type II alveolar lung cells, oesophagus, heart and kidney [20, 21] . Structurally, it comprises a N-terminal peptidase domain (PD) able to bind the virion S glycoprotein, and a C-terminal Collectrinlike domain (CLD) [22, 23] . The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with ACE2 at the surface of type II pneumocytes with similar affinity to SARS-CoV S glycoprotein [24, 25] . The crystal structures of coronaviruses components showed the presence of N-linked glycans overlay on the surface of S, and it has been proposed as a mechanism for the virus to elude the immune system [26, 27] . In detail, in a first stage, the host immune system fails to recognize the coronaviruses as pathogens due to the presence of S glycoproteins bearing numerous sugar entities over the membrane. In fact, the immune system confuses the virus with normal sugar-coated host cells and does not react to them. In this FULL PAPER 2 way, viral S glycoproteins bind allowing the virus to enter into the host cells [28] . The glycosylation region is found mainly on S1 subunit, and it includes the RBD [29] . Starting from these evidences, several research efforts have been done to tackle SARS-CoV-2 infection spreading trying to identify potential therapeutics [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Indeed, several neutralizing antibodies recognize S glycoprotein as main antigen, suggesting that it could be a potential target for rational design of vaccines and therapeutics [19, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] . The RBD could be a valid region to explore for the design of novel drugs [46] . In the past outbreaks, SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was confirmed as the site of action of neutralizing antibodies, such as S230 antibody, isolated from human survivors [47] [48] [49] . In 2019, Walls et al. showed that S230 blocked the virus-host receptor binding and induced a conformational change in the fusion machinery with a ratcheting mechanism. S glycoprotein in complex with S230 was characterized in a closed and open state (PDB IDs: 6NB6 and 6NB7, respectively). The analysis of SARS-CoV -antibody complex revealed that the S230 epitope is located near Leu443 residue, and Tyr442 and Tyr475 are residues involved in the interaction. These residues are normally involved in the binding with ACE2 strengthening the hypothesis that S230 acts as a competitive inhibitor of coronavirus-host receptor interaction [50] . In this work, we describe a computational analysis of the interaction between S protein and ACE2 peptidase domain, with the aim of 1) identifying a putative druggable area on the RBD interface; 2) targeting this site with an in silico high-throughput screening campaign. The main goal is to identify small molecules as potential modulators of the entry step of the viral life cycle, thus providing the scientific community with a suitable starting point for drug discovery efforts on S target. Indeed, a potential drug able to modulate this protein-protein interaction (PPI) could work as a fusion inhibitor, representing an interesting strategy already investigated for emerging viruses outbreaks [51] . Inhibitors of viral entry are likely to block the viral spreading and reduce the viral load at the very beginning of the infection. It is important to underline that the molecular contacts between S glycoprotein and ACE2 are widespread within the interaction interface and therefore it may be challenging to design small molecule modulators capable of inhibiting the RBD domain. However, the S glycoprotein RBD-ACE2 recognition process is mainly mediated by hydrophilic interactions contrary to the most common PPI hydrophobic nature [52, 53] . Considering that the strategy of targeting the virus-human interface with monoclonal antibodies and vaccines has been thoroughly explored with a robust preclinical and clinical pipeline [54, 55] , we decided to follow a different avenue. Therefore, we focused our attention on a computational approach assessing the binding contribution of each amino acid interactions, to identify suitable druggable hot spots or binding pockets. In the context of the current health emergency, the resulting hypothesis and the potential hit compounds identified may be useful tools for other research groups and for the entire scientific community to initiate drug discovery programmes and identify novel small molecules against COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 334, "end": 337, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 477, "end": 480, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 696, "end": 699, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 700, "end": 702, "text": "4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 829, "end": 832, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 833, "end": 835, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 947, "end": 950, "text": "[7,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 951, "end": 953, "text": "8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1142, "end": 1145, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1146, "end": 1150, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1151, "end": 1155, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1266, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1542, "end": 1546, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1678, "text": "[14,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1682, "text": "15]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2375, "end": 2379, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2380, "end": 2384, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2385, "end": 2389, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2544, "end": 2548, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2799, "end": 2803, "text": "[20,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2804, "end": 2807, "text": "21]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2957, "end": 2961, "text": "[22,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2962, "end": 2965, "text": "23]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3103, "end": 3107, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3108, "end": 3111, "text": "25]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3315, "end": 3319, "text": "[26,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3320, "end": 3323, "text": "27]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3729, "end": 3733, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3816, "end": 3820, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3977, "end": 3981, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3982, "end": 3986, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3987, "end": 3991, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3992, "end": 3996, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3997, "end": 4001, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4002, "end": 4006, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4007, "end": 4011, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4012, "end": 4016, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4017, "end": 4021, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4022, "end": 4026, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4027, "end": 4031, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4212, "end": 4216, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4217, "end": 4221, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4222, "end": 4226, "text": "[42]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4227, "end": 4231, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4232, "end": 4236, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4237, "end": 4241, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4317, "end": 4321, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4488, "end": 4492, "text": "[47]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4493, "end": 4497, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4498, "end": 4502, "text": "[49]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4514, "end": 4526, "text": "Walls et al.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5138, "end": 5142, "text": "[50]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 5843, "end": 5847, "text": "[51]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6384, "end": 6388, "text": "[52,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6389, "end": 6392, "text": "53]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 6581, "end": 6585, "text": "[54,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6586, "end": 6589, "text": "55]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The currently available X-ray crystal structures show that SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein forms a long trimer with a triangular cross-section, containing the receptor-binding motif (RBM), responsible for the recognition process of ACE2 [56] . The RBD is composed by a core and an extensive loop, RBM [57] , and shows two different conformations: the \"up state\" (PDB ID: 6VYB) ( Figure S1 , on the left) and the \"down state\" (PDB ID: 6VXX) ( Figure S1 , on the right). In the first X-ray crystal structure, two S chains are in down-state and the third one is in up-state, whereas the other trimeric structure presents all S chains in down state [58] . When the S glycoprotein is in up conformation, an extended loop of the RBD surrounds the ACE2 interface, while in down conformation is buried into the interface between S1/S2 subunits. The structure alignment of SARS-CoV-2 S trimers in open and closed states highlights the exposition of RBD loop on the virion surface, enabling the interaction with the host receptor. As previous works revealed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the open conformation is required to allow the binding between S protein and ACE2, triggering the infection mechanism, and thus leading to conformational changes and membrane fusion [58, 59] . In fact, in the open state, the S1 loop exposes residues of the receptor-binding motif, known to be involved in the binding with ACE2, otherwise hidden in the closed state ( Figure 1 ), suggesting that the opening process of this loop is necessary to establish the interaction with ACE2 PD.

The structure alignment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs both in complex with ACE2 showed that the interface between the two S glycoproteins and ACE2 is similar. A total of 18 residues of RBD in SARS-CoV-2 are involved in the interaction with ACE2. Among them, nine are equivalent in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and include Tyr436-Tyr449, Tyr440-Tyr453, Asn473-Asn487, Tyr475-Tyr489, Gly482-Gly496, Thr486-Thr500, Gly488-Gly502, Tyr491-Tyr505, respectively.

Although the RBMs are very similar, a few changes involving the residue positions can affect the binding affinity between S glycoprotein and ACE2. The main mutation seems to involve Val404 residue in SARS-CoV, replaced by Lys417 in SARS-CoV-2, in the middle region of RBD. The side chain of Lys417 forms a salt-bridge with the acid group of Asp30 of ACE2, probably strengthening the bimolecular interaction between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2, while Val404 residue does not seem to be involved in any interaction. At the same time, the replacement of Arg426 in SARS-CoV with Asn439 amino acid in SARS-CoV-2 takes away two prominent salt-bridge contacts with ACE2 Asn329 residue, weakening the PPI [59, 61] . However, the conservation of several contact residues could explain the overall similar binding affinity, reported in literature with KD values of 1.2 nM for SARS-CoV-2 and 5 nM for SARS-CoV [58] , respectively.

It is noteworthy that this bi-molecular interaction is not a traditional example of PPI, in which the interaction interfaces are often shallow with lack of deep pockets and it does not bear a canonical active site to target with a synthetic ligand. In general, in PPI, both protein partners establish high affinity contacts through the so-called hot spot amino acids [62] . These residues are mainly hydrophobic and usually widely dislocated along the whole protein surfaces, and thus sequentially not connected among them within the same protein, creating a discontinuous epitope [63] [64] [65] . Notably, from the currently available PDB structures of ACE2-S protein interaction (PDB IDs: 6M17 and 6M0J), the complex shows a one to one interaction pattern, where the contacts between the two proteins are mediated mainly by hydrogen bonds, some salt bridges and few Van der Waals forces. Due to the width of this protein-protein interface, it was possible to identify three regions of interaction, such as N-terminal, central and C-terminal regions ( Figure 2 ). Both PDB structures show mostly the same key interactions between S protein and ACE2 PD. More in detail, at the N-terminus, the main interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 PD involve the following residues: Thr500 and Tyr41 hydroxyl groups establish a hydrogen bond; Gly502 backbone NH interacts with the backbone carbonyl of Lys353; Gly446 carbonyl makes contact with Gln42 side chain; Tyr449 hydroxyl side chain connects to Asp38 and Gln42 side chains; Tyr505 hydroxyl group shows an interaction with Glu37 side chain; and Gly496 backbone carbonyl group interacts with Lys353 side chain. In the middle region of the interaction interface, it is reported a hydrogen bond interaction of the aromatic hydroxyl side chain of Tyr453 with the side chain of His34, while Lys417 establishes a salt bridge and hydrogen bond with Asp30 of ACE2 peptidase domain. Finally, at the C-terminus, Asn487 side chain of S protein forms H-bond interaction with ACE2 Gln24 and Tyr83 side chains [61] . In order to quantitatively explore the relevance of specific interacting residues at the ACE2-S glycoprotein interaction interface, a computational alanine scanning was performed on both PDB structures. Although this technique may be inaccurate, it offers a rapid insight about protein-protein hot spots affinity relevance [66] . Thus, the complexes were optimized at pH 7.4 and the resulted structures were used to perform the alanine scanning calculation, one per each protein-protein complex. The computational alanine scanning calculated value changes in free energy of binding affinity (\u2206\u2206Gaffinity) between protein partners, after applying mutations to alanine for those residues participating in the PPI interface. The tool provided \u2206\u2206Gaffinity values, measuring the difference between the free energy of the mutated complex and the \u2206Gaffinity of the wild-type complex. Therefore, a positive \u2206\u2206Gaffinity indicates a reduction in proteinprotein binding affinity for the complex, and it provides indication the contribution of each amino acid to the binding affinity. Thus, it is possible to conclude that not all the mutations are equally important. Usually, a crucial interaction hot spot is identified when mutation to alanine in a given position causes a change in \u2206\u2206G \u2265 2.0 kcal/mol [67] , while residues with \u2206\u2206G < 2 kcal/mol are defined neutral [68] . According to Beard et al., the computational alanine scanning results performed using Schr\u00f6dinger suite have a correlation with the experimental ones, and a residue can be defined as an interaction hot spot, if its mutation to alanine generates a \u2206\u2206Gaffinity \u2265 3.0 kcal/mol [69] . In table S2, the \u2206\u2206Gaffinity values are reported for the residues showing values \u2265 3.0 kcal/mol for ACE2 and S glycoprotein interaction according to the three interface regions ( Figure S4 ). When analysing these results, all the identified hot spots of S glycoproteins are common between the two alanine scanning experiments, while for ACE2 some hot spot residues differ from one PDB to another. For this reason, only the common hot spots were taken further in our study, considering that the non-shared hot spots are likely not crucial. Furthermore, the obtained \u2206\u2206Gaffinity values allowed us to create a sort of contribution-to-binding ranking, discriminating the most relevant hot spots from the less important residues. In this scenario, for ACE2 peptidase domain (from PDB 6M17), the key residues were Tyr41, involved in the recognition at N-terminal region, Tyr83 in the C-terminal region and His34 in the central region. Referring to the other PDB structure 6M0J, the most valued residues were found in the N-terminal region, with Tyr41, Gln42, Gln24 and Lys353, while Tyr83 and Lys31 belonged to the C-term and middle region, respectively. At the same time, for S glycoprotein from PDB 6M17 the residues Phe486 and Tyr489 in the Cterminal region were found to be crucial, while in the N-terminal region Thr500, Gly496, and Asn501 were the amino acid contributing the most to the binding. Looking at PDB 6M0J, the most valued residues were Asn487 and Phe486 involved in the C-terminal region, Lys417 and Gln493 in the middle region, and Tyr505, Asn501 and Thr500 in the N-terminal. In conclusion, notably, the majority of identified hot spots for both proteins were significantly involved in N-terminal region (Table  S2) , suggesting this part of the protein-protein interface as fundamental for the interaction compared to the central and the C-terminal regions. In particular, Tyr41 aromatic hydroxyl residue, Lys353 backbone carbonyl and Gln42 side chain of ACE2 seem to be the key recognition features in the interaction with the RBD domain of S glycoprotein and may pave the way forward in the selection and design of novel RBD S small molecule modulators.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 586, "end": 590, "text": "[62]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 800, "end": 804, "text": "[63]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 805, "end": 809, "text": "[64]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 810, "end": 814, "text": "[65]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2266, "end": 2270, "text": "[61]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2596, "end": 2600, "text": "[66]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3566, "end": 3570, "text": "[67]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3630, "end": 3634, "text": "[68]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 3911, "end": 3915, "text": "[69]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1272, "end": 1280, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 4097, "end": 4106, "text": "Figure S4", "ref_id": "FIGREF4"}, {"start": 5636, "end": 5647, "text": "(Table  S2)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Computational alanine scanning on SARS-CoV-2 -ACE2 interaction interface"}, {"text": "The above analysis provided several information about crucial interactions between the two protein partners, only from a static point of view. Therefore, in order to get more comprehensive data about crucial contacts, the two PDB structures of ACE2-Spike protein complex (PDB IDs: 6M17 and 6M0J) were used to perform two MD simulations of 200 nanoseconds each in water solvent. The experiments were performed using Desmond [70] with the aim of exploring the frequency and stability of interactions during the whole trajectories. For PDB 6M17, chain B (ACE2 PD) and chain E (SARS-CoV-2 RBD) were included in the MD, while for PDB 6M0J chain A (ACE2 PD) and chain E (SARS-CoV-2 RBD) were considered. For both MD simulations, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) plot was generated to check the stability of the protein-protein complexes during the simulation, including also energy, temperature and pressure of the systems during the trajectories. For PDB 6M17 the system reached a stationary shape at about 30 nanoseconds of simulation, while for PDB 6M0J it was obtained at about 80 nanoseconds of trajectory (table  S3) . All the other parameters turned out to be reliable for a further analysis. Thus, the frames of both trajectories (1001 per simulation) were clustered applying average as hierarchical cluster linkage method to identify five representative clusters for all frames for PDB 6M17, and ten clusters for PDB 6M0J. According to the RMSD plot, only frames corresponding to the stable trajectory portion -after 30 nanoseconds for 6M17 and after 80 nanoseconds for 6M0J -were considered to retrieve the most abundant and frequent interactions amongst the clusters. Table 1 summarises the related results, and details about H-bond frequency occurrences are displayed in Table S4 . Although MD performed on PDB 6M17 (cryo-EM) highlighted a fewer number of interactions than PDB 6M0J (X-ray), this fact should be ascribed to the different methods applied to resolve 3D structures and the consequent different starting points for MD simulations. However, the two MD simulations shared ten equal interactions, that were considered the most important; besides for those different contacts, most of the involved amino acids were highlighted for both MD. Notably, the information retrieved from both MD simulations were mainly in accordance with data from literature and computational alanine scanning approaches.

As above mentioned, we focused our attention on the portion of interaction interface we considered most targetable, i.e. the N-terminal region, neglecting the other two portions. Therefore, from PDB 6M17, the pharmacophore of N-term was composed by three features (Figure 4 , on the left): a hydrogenbond donor on Tyr41 side chain hydroxyl and two hydrogen bond acceptors, namely one on Lys353 backbone carbonyl and another on carboxyl of Glu37 side chain of ACE2 PD.

All rights reserved. The comparison of the two pharmacophore maps showed that both PDB complexes shared two comparable features on Lys353 and Glu37, while the features corresponding to the Tyr41 side chain hydroxyl were different. In PDB 6M17, the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group formed a H-bond to Asn501 side chain of S protein, while in PDB 6M0J, the hydrogen of the same hydroxyl accepted a H-bond from Thr500 side chain. Therefore, the same hydroxyl group of Tyr41 side chain could act as H-bond acceptor or donor. In light of these findings, the information from both pharmacophores were considered equally important, and a shared pharmacophore was created (Figure 4 , on the right), including overall seven features from both PDB complexes. Indeed, the high number of features could be too strict for this preliminary virtual screening, thus limiting the opportunity to identify potentially promising compounds. For this reason, the shared pharmacophore was modified according to alanine scanning \u2206\u2206Gaffinity values, taking into account that Glu37 and Asp38 were the less valued hot spots compared to Tyr41, Gln42 and Lys353. Therefore, the negative ionisable feature corresponding to Asp38 was removed and two H-bond acceptor features corresponding to Glu37 and Asp38 were marked as optional, i.e. they were considered less important for screening purposes. Then, pharmacophore screenings were run, where no omitted features were permitted. For MolPort library, 19 molecules were retrieved from the initial 1,000, while 22 compounds were obtained from the initial 1,000 PPI library molecules. Some virtual hit molecules were nucleoside analogues as a consequence of the highly hydrophilic nature of the binding side. However, these molecules were discarded from the overall selection of the consensus molecules, as we considered these not suitable to enter hit-to-lead optimization from a drug discovery perspective. Finally, 8 compounds were selected as the most promising ones taking into consideration MM-GBSA and chemical diversity.
