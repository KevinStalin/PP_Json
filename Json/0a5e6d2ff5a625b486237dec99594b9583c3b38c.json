            "text": "National rates of aquatic food consumption in Pacific Island Countries and Territories are among the highest in the world, yet the region is suffering from extensive levels of diet-related ill health. The aim of this paper is to examine the variation in consumption patterns and in nutrient composition of aquatic foods in the Pacific, to help improve understanding of their contribution to food and nutrition security. For this examination we analysed nutrient composition data and trade data from two novel region-specific databases, as well as consumption data from national and village level surveys for two Melanesian case studies, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands. Results demonstrated that consumption depends on availability and the amount and type of aquatic food consumed, and its contribution to nutrition security varies within different geographic and socio-demographic contexts. More data is needed on locally relevant species and consumption patterns, to better inform dietary guidelines and improve public health both now and into the future. Advice on aquatic food consumption must consider the nutrient composition and quantity of products consumed, as well as accessibility through local food systems, to ensure they contribute to diverse and healthy diets.",

Annual average consumption by coastal rural populations ranges from 30-118 kg per person in Melanesia, 62-115 kg in Micronesia, and 50-146 kg in Polynesia [2] . Aquatic food provides 50-90% of the dietary animal protein in rural areas [1] . While consumption in urban centres is lower than in rural areas, it usually still exceeds the global average of around 20 kg per person per year [3] . Aquatic foods are highly nutritious [4] , however, despite the high rate of aquatic food consumption, many PICTs experience extensive levels of diet-related ill health [5] .",

As a result of urbanization and the growth of food imports, dietary patterns have shifted from traditional diets comprising a variety of fresh fish, tubers and local vegetables toward diets high in fat and sugar [12, 15] . These dietary changes have been influenced by multiple drivers including limited access to land within urban centres, low household incomes and the availability of cheaper and convenient, imported and processed foods such as noodles, white rice, and canned fish and meats [12, 16] . This ongoing dietary transition, combined with the resulting over-reliance on commercially sourced foods and consumption of a poor variety of foods, has led to the subsequent rise in food and nutrition insecurity and non-communicable diseases [15] [16] [17] . However, dietary transitions and their impacts unfold differently at local scales and are not adequately captured in national data.",

More than 300 species of finfish are harvested by small-scale fisheries as well as a range of invertebrate species [27] , although relatively few species dominate small-scale, commercial reef fisheries in the western and central areas of the region. While invertebrates such as trochus and sea cucumber are commonly harvested for export, many invertebrates including molluscs, crustaceans and cephalopods may be as critically important in the Pacific as in other subsistence fisheries and local markets [28] , but there are limited catch statistics available [29, 30] . The volume of production from coastal subsistence fisheries is generally greater than that from coastal commercial fishing, and involves hundreds of different taxa, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans, algae and other groups [31] . The potential for aquaculture to contribute to food and nutrition security in the Pacific has been recognised, in particular for pond aquaculture enterprises in peri-urban areas [32] . However, much of the investment made in establishing animal aquaculture has targeted export commodity markets with limited scope for food security [33] . Investments have also been made in diversifying seaweed industries in Pacific island countries with the aim of improving marine-based livelihoods through food and health applications [34] . The variation in aquatic food types, their nutrient composition and patterns of consumption is important from a health and nutrition perspective and represents a significant data gap.",

However, broad promotion of aquatic food consumption on its own is unlikely to result in improved health outcomes in the Pacific Island context. Filling data gaps on the contribution of aquatic food to Pacific diets, based on the availability of different aquatic food types and their nutrient composition, is essential for addressing food and nutrition security. In addition, developing a better understanding of the variation in consumption among countries, across urban and rural divides, and within intra-household distribution of food is critical to improving public health interventions. In particular, understanding consumption of aquatic foods in the context of broader dietary diversity in nutritionally vulnerable groups, particularly women and children, will be key to leveraging aquatic foods to address intergenerational malnutrition [36] . This study contributes to the development of a more holistic understanding of why NCDs and malnutrition remain prevalent amidst such high rates of national aquatic food consumption.",

The region experienced a rapid 30% drop in domestic crop production during the 1980s which has not been recovered-these declining trends in domestic food production have happened concurrently with the doubling of food net-imports [39] . The variation in local environments, combined with factors such as distance to markets, can influence diets and nutrient intake.

            "text": "The diversity in fishing practices, marine resource consumption and dependency on the sea across PICTs is rooted in the various social and physical factors shaping island lives. Early human migration into the region by different ethnic groups from South East Asia and Australasia has formed three distinct ethnographic regions; including Melanesia spanning the western islands to the north and northeast of Australia, and Micronesia and Polynesia spanning the islands respectively north of New Guinea and east into the central Pacific Ocean. In geophysical terms, the Andesite line forms a geological divide that traces a deep ocean trench along the western tectonic shelf and separates the continental islands to its west from the oceanic islands to its east ( Figure 1 ). As such, Melanesia's large and high-elevation continental islands provide better agriculture conditions, and thus over time have come to support larger, culturally and linguistically diverse populations that maintain a more landward livelihood orientation. The land area and population of Melanesia account for about 98% and 90% of the regions' total [41] , harbouring around 1500 indigenous languages [42] . The smaller more dispersed oceanic islands of Micronesia and Polynesia on the other hand, include low-lying coral atolls with poor soils and volcanic islands that have extreme topography. These islands over time have come to support smaller populations that have settled along coastlines, and exhibit a stronger seaward orientation in their culture and livelihood. Living in a maritime region where, if excluding Papua New Guinea, less than 0.5% (about 88,600 km 2 of the estimated total 27 million km 2 ) of the combined area of the 22 PICTs' jurisdictions is land [43] , rural Pacific islander life reflects an existence characterized by limited social and economic connectivity due to relative isolation of its many islands. (Due to its size, Papua New Guinea skews the region's population and land area statistics, hiding the region's predominant island environment. When including Papua New Guinea, about 1.8% of total jurisdiction is land (about 550,000 km 2 of the approximate 30 million km 2 total area). Papua New Guinea and New Zealand are not included in this analysis.) ",

Most land is forested, or of extreme topography, and only 12% is estimated to be cultivated. The agriculture sector, including fishing, makes up 26% of the gross domestic product (US$ 802 million) [46] . Major urban populations center around Luganville, on the island of Espiritu Santo, and the country's capital Port Vila on the island of Efate. Growth of these urban populations is significant, with an estimated 2.9% annual growth [47] , putting increased pressure on domestic food production systems to meet demand for food. In rural areas, households derive most of their income and consumption needs from agriculture-based activities, with 32% from sales of agriculture and home-made products at local markets and 39% from subsistence production [48] . On average, over half (56%) of household annual expenditure is on food (62% and 42% respectively for rural and urban populations) [48] . In 2013, the government of Vanuatu set out a policy direction to address food and nutrition security challenges in the country. Therein it \"outlines a holistic approach to address all key elements of food security along the food chain from farm to fork, i.e., from primary production, processing, trading, marketing, preparation and consumption\", with emphasis put on \"investing in improving and increasing production and productivity of the agricultural and fisheries sectors\" [49] (p. 12).",

The PNDB presents values per 100 g edible portions for total energy, all macronutrients, fibre, and 17 micronutrients. The PNDB authors' process was limited by the availability of secondary data, where items were matched to their closest taxa or description; not all micronutrients are represented in the PNDB for this reason. For example, while aquatic food is a rich source of marine long chain omega -3 fatty acids, iodine and selenium [58, 59] , these nutrients are absent from the current iteration of the PNDB. Other key nutrients relevant to aquatic food as a source are included, such as protein, calcium, iron, zinc, vitamin A and vitamin B12. As such, nine nutrients are displayed within this paper based on their inclusion in the PNDB, their relevance to aquatic food and the purpose of the study.",

The tool does not quantify amounts of the reported food group consumed or quantify intakes of processed/excess non-nutritious foods. Instead, it is a measure of the number of different food groups consumed, as recalled by respondents in the 24 h recall period. The MDD-W tool and study method detailed by Albert et al.

However, two aquatic food groups do comprise substantial trade quantities; tuna and canned fish. The dominant fishery in the Pacific, in terms of total catch volume is the oceanic tuna fishery. A large portion of the fishery occurs within PICT national waters, with harvesting conducted predominantly by foreign-flagged vessels and transhipped to countries outside the region. Only a small portion is harvested by domestic vessels. These fisheries provide significant benefit to PICTs, including foreign fleet revenues and contributions of landed catch to GDP [64] . We present existing tuna harvest data (Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency (https://www.ffa.int/catch_value), in terms of potentially available grams per capita per day to consider the potential role of commercial tuna in Pacific diets. Papua New Guinea was excluded from analysis because it is more agriculture focused and has a human population size which exceeds all other PICTs combined, and would, therefore, skew interpretation. Canned fish, including tuna, mackerel, sardines and pilchards comprise an increasing portion of Pacific diets [65] . Here we assess apparent consumption of canned fish import data using the new Pacific Food Trade Database (PFTD) [66] . The PFTD was developed to better understand international trade in food and beverages in the region. The database is based on data from BACI international trade database, which amends Comtrade data [67] , including the use of mirror data to fill gaps. Development of the PFTD included significant expert input to identify categorical errors (e.g., commodity, exporter, and importer) and imputation to address quantity errors. The resulting database, covering all food and beverage trade for 18 PICTs for the years 1995-2018, addresses substantial error in global data and delivers the benchmark in reliable food and beverage trade data for the region.",

For example, variation exists between rural and urban consumers ( Table 2) and between communities, partially as a result of availability. Solomon Islanders each consume, on average, 73 kg of aquatic food (all types) per year. In contrast, 14 kg of aquatic food is consumed per person per year in Vanuatu, which is less than the global average of 20 kg/p.c./year [68] . Within Solomon Islands, rural consumption of pelagic fish alone is equivalent to the global average consumption of aquatic food, with an additional 63 kg/p.c./year of other fish and seafood consumed. Urban consumption of 48 kg/year of aquatic food is still high in terms of the global average, but is much lower than rural consumption of 83 kg/yr. Different types of aquatic food make different contributions to consumption, for example, shellfish account for over 15% of total consumption in Solomon Islands and 4% in Vanuatu. Within Solomon Islands, shellfish account for 17% or rural aquatic food consumption and 7% of urban consumption ( Table 2 ). Canned fish is consumed more by urban than rural consumers in both Vanuatu and Solomon Islands. Urban and rural consumers typically have different access to healthy and nutritious food, as well as differing dietary gaps. As demonstrated by this variance in volumes and types of aquatic foods consumed, further food and nutrition requirements must be considered within a localized context to inform relevant and appropriate interventions to address dietary gaps.

There are, however, drastic differences in harvest, on a per capita basis, between Pacific sub-regions.

These quantities relative to PICT populations and economies represent a profound asset in terms of revenue, although in terms of food and nutrition security, the majority of this nutritional value is exported from the region.

Fisheries, such as the oceanic tuna fishery, represent a profound asset in terms of revenue, although in terms of food and nutrition security, the majority of this nutritional value is exported from the region. While most Pacific Islanders consume large amounts of aquatic food, this consumption is part of a diet that does not meet the recommended dietary diversity. More data is needed on the micronutrient content of locally relevant aquatic foods, as well as on whole diet consumption at regional, national, household and individual levels, to improve public health, particularly in regions where aquatic food consumption is already high, yet overall dietary diversity remains low.",

As a result, the nutrient composition of different aquatic foods varies considerably and the nutritional value of aquatic food far exceeds its common description as a quality protein source. Aquatic food is an important source of micronutrients, of which several are of public health concern in the Pacific Island region. Sardine, crabs, crayfish, turtle and canned fish, for example, are good sources of calcium, highlighting these alternate calcium sources of importance as compared to the negligible dairy intake reported by the diet diversity respondents in this, and other, research [25] . Iron rich species such as bivalves and gastropods, seaweed and sardines, are important sources of iron which can contribute to meeting iron requirements in Pacific populations suffering diet and parasitic related anemia [7] . Aquatic foods have also been identified for provision of high biological vitamin A, as well as calcium, iron and zinc and as a target food for combating these micronutrient deficiencies in S/SE Asia [59, 71] .",

National consumption in some PICTs already exceeds of this amount, yet major health problems continue to plague a large proportion of the Pacific population [9, 75, 76] . While most Pacific Islanders consume large amounts of aquatic food, this consumption is part of a diet that does not meet the recommended dietary diversity. With exceptions, such as Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea, recommendations to increase \"fish\" consumption at national levels are unlikely to benefit the health of the population. Contemporary national level recommendations around \"fish\" or \"seafood\" now need to take in to account the varied needs of different population groups, the food groups that are absent from their diets and the relative nutritional benefits of different aquatic foods. For example, the village site in Solomon Islands with the lowest dietary diversity score showed almost all people ate aquatic foods including fish, shellfish and canned tuna. In this situation, health advice should be to maintain consumption of aquatic foods in conjunction with messages to increase the diversity of other foods consumed. In contrast, where dietary diversity is higher, but consumption of aquatic foods is lower and less diverse, health messages should focus on increasing diversity of aquatic food consumption for improved nutrition rather than increasing consumption per se. Achieving Recommended Dietary Intakes (RDIs) for specific nutrients through one source of aquatic food, for example a species group such as tuna, is unrealistic. RDIs should instead be reached through a combination of different food groups, including a diverse range of aquatic food.",

Canning an otherwise highly perishable food greatly increases access to aquatic food for people that do not have reliable access to fresh fish or refrigeration, but canned fish can be high in salt and consuming high amounts can lead to negative health implications [82] .

While landing more tuna may help contribute to filling the supply gap from declines in coastal fisheries, it may not have the same nutrient densities as the aquatic foods it replaces. Higher quantities of tuna may need to be consumed to get the same amount of a micronutrient and eating this volume of tuna may be unrealistic. A large volume of tuna is already consumed domestically, from a number of sources including domestically produced and imported canned tuna, products entering the region from foreign-flagged tuna vessels, catch from domestic commercial fleets, and coastal artisanal capture from various methods including the use of fish aggregation devices (FADS). However, the total quantity of tuna consumed across PICTs, or for individual PICTs is not accurately known. Such information is essential for measuring the success of the food security goal of the Regional Roadmap for Sustainable Pacific Fisheries [90] , which aims to increase access to tuna for domestic consumption by 40,000 tonnes between 2015 and 2024.",

Given the large differences in per capita harvest rates between Pacific sub-regions and individual PICTs, an understanding of the geopolitical heterogeneity of harvestable tuna will be essential for understanding the potential role of the fishery in meeting future dietary requirements in the region [64] . Other fisheries including inshore finfish and invertebrates, which already contribute to local livelihoods and food security, can potentially play a greater role in food and nutrition security in the Pacific. Inshore species have a varied nutrient composition and together with tuna present a nutrition sensitive approach to increase the supply of aquatic foods. In addition, invertebrates are predicted to be impacted by climate change to a lesser degree than other aquatic foods [26] , and future dietary advice will need to consider these eventualities. Where consumption of these species is currently low, efforts to promote consumption may be needed, particularly to target nutrient deficiency in vulnerable groups. Developing messaging around \"culturally significant local aquatic foods\" may help promote consumption via targeting foods significant to a local environment that may not currently have a place on the \"daily plate\" for various reasons. Linking these foods with their high nutritional value could potentially increase their consumption. For example, the small mud whelk found in mangroves is often considered a \"poor persons food\" i.e., people collect it when they have nothing else. If this food source was celebrated for its nutritional value, it may help increase its consumption. Care would also need to be taken to ensure overexploitation did not occur.",

Developing a better picture of variability in aquatic foods is also important for understanding the effects of these contaminants, as well as toxins which cause poisoning such as ciguatera. Mercury levels are typically low in fast growing species but are much higher in larger fish, such as some tunas [91] . Excess consumption of fish with high mercury levels, particularly by pregnant women and children, is harmful [92] . Understanding mercury contamination and safe levels of consumption for each species and size of tuna in PICTs will become increasingly important from a public health perspective if more tuna is landed nationally, rather than exported [93] .",

CFP, the most frequently reported seafood toxin illness in the world, can produce a diverse array of complex and debilitating symptoms [94] . CFP is caused by consumption of coral reef associated fish contaminated by ciguatoxin and related toxins from dinoflagellates (microalgae) and cyanobacteria. The toxin bioaccumulates up the food web, with particular fish species being more prone to having higher levels of ciguatoxin [94] . Presence of ciguatoxic fish not only causes ill-health but can alter fishing practices and overall fishing effort which reduces local fish consumption. Public health challenges, in terms of both CFP symptoms and nutrition have worsened over the past 35 years, and are expected to continue to do so as the coastal habitats continue to degrade [95] . In addition to CFP, scrombroid syndrome can result from eating \"spoiled fish\", particularly tuna and other, mostly pelagic species, in the family Scombridae. While the syndrome has been reported in local hospitals in Solomon Islands, it is generally considered an underreported form of food poisoning [90] . Improving fish hygiene and ensuring food safety and quality along supply chains will be essential components of improving the contribution of aquatic foods to nutrition.",
