However, COVID-19 has also been detected in nonrespiratory specimens, such as stool, blood, ocular secretions, and semen, but the role of these sites in the transmission is uncertain. [4] [5] [6] As of 18 May, as in many countries, the number of daily new diagnosed cases in Turkey is still over 1000. 1 This is due to the ability of the COVID-19 virus to spread rapidly from human to human through direct contact or respiratory droplets. Especially within 2 m of an infected person, the transmission risk is even higher. 7 Although bronchoscopy is a procedure used for the diagnosis and treatment of various conditions, it is also known as an aerosolgenerating procedure, so it results in a high risk of infection for health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. 8 On the other hand, throughout the pandemic, patients continued to be admitted with symptoms not related to COVID-19 infection, but as a result of suspected lung cancer instead. In these patients, bronchoscopy or endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) played an important role in both diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we reviewed the bronchoscopic procedures performed during the pandemic in an interventional pulmonology unit in Turkey and stated how we proceeded with these bronchoscopic procedures and precautions without any published guidelines on this subject. Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with a dedicated scanner (EU-ME1; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) was used to examine the lymph nodes of patients. All procedures were done by a minimum possible number of health care workers, such as one or two bronchoscopists, one member of the medical staff, an anesthesiologist, and a technician. All physicians and ancillary staff were tested for COVID-19 during hospital health screening and no positivity was detected. Only one ancillary staff was tested again after traveled to another city and resulted as negative but he was also isolated for 14 days then continued to work again together with us.",

            "text": "In line with these precautions taken during the first 2 months of the pandemic period, a total of 36 interventional procedures, 74 EBUS-TBNA, and 16 FOB were performed. Even though Ost DE recommends testing all patients before the procedure, we only tested 31 of 126 (24.6%) patients. 15 Although this was due to the difficulty of accessing tests during the initial pandemic, we decided it was more appropriate to test patients with a higher likelihood of infection based on symptoms, since the false negativity of the test was about 67% in the following days. 16 The first American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology statement was published in late March; in the following days, expert opinions on the use of bronchoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic were published one after another. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] While the use of PPE and bronchoscopy indications were similar between the published reports and our practice, not using negative pressure rooms, not testing all patients, using a reusable bronchoscope and only giving a 30-minute interval between the procedures are the notable differences between the reports and our practice. We proved that these differences did not cause any problems in the detection of COVID-19 in either patients and health care workers after the procedure.",

            "text": "Although it has been reported that a brief delay (2-3 weeks) will not harm cancer diagnosis and staging, 22 how long the COVID-19 pandemic will continue is still unknown. Bronchoscopy is often required both for diagnosis and staging, and timeliness of bronchoscopic diagnosis impacts every stage of lung cancer care. Also, EBUS for staging and diagnosis as the first test in patients with T1-3, N1-3, and M0 disease has been shown to decreases complications, the number of tests required and time to treatment. 23 Moreover, delays in care may lead to missed opportunities in terms of cure or palliation for lung cancer. So, whether it is judicious to delay bronchoscopy or EBUS of patients with known or suspected lung cancer in this unknown process is the question at hand. Based on our experience, the answer to this question is no, EBUS and/or bronchoscopy should not be postponed in patients with known or suspected lung cancer; we determined that COVID-19 transmission can be prevented by taken sufficient and necessary precautions.",

GeneXpert (Cepheid Inc; Sunnyvale, CA) assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was positive in bronchial washing in a nonresolving pneumonia case and specific treatments were started.In addition, FOB was applied through an endotracheal tube in six patients with complete lung collapse who could not be provided with adequate oxygenation with mechanical ventilation. After mucus and fibrin plugs were removed, ventilation was provided in all patients (Figure 2G,H) and Acinetobacter baumannii positivity was also detected in two patients' bronchial washing cultures. Before the procedure, the COVID-19 PCR test via oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal swabs were performed in 8/16 patients (50%, six patients of which were in the intensive care unit) and all were found to be negative.4 | DISCUSSIONThe first case of COVID-19 in Turkey was reported on 11 March 2020 9 and an increasing number of infections were quickly reported.The Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health quickly made arrangements in the health system. First, pandemic hospitals were determined in all cities but specific branch hospitals, such as oncology and respiratory units, were excluded; these hospitals continued working routinely, which was extremely crucial for malignant patients with ongoing treatment and patients with suspected cancer.However, COVID-19 polyclinics were opened in all hospitals across the country and all patients who applied to these outpatient clinics were tested in line with the guidelines: cough, fever, shortness of breath, a history of coming from abroad, or a history of contact with F I G U R E 1 Flow chart of the study OZTURK ET AL.",

The medical files of 126 patients following the first case seen in Turkey (11 March 2020-15 May 2020; \u223c8 weeks) were evaluated retrospectively. Bronchoscopic procedures were grouped as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) in an intensive care unit or a standard bronchoscopy room, interventional bronchoscopic techniques via rigid bronchoscopy, and EBUS guided-transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). All interventional procedures were performed under general intravenously administered anesthesia.
