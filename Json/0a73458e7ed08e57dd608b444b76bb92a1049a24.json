Evidence of patterns within these conditions can support decisionmaking by identifying where action is urgent and which policies and interventions are needed to mitigate negative impacts and enhance positive impacts. Within the scope of the EU-funded project EURO-HEALTHY (Shaping EUROpean policies to promote HEALTH equitY), the City of Lisbon was selected as a case study to apply a multidimensional and participatory assessment approach of urban health whose purpose was to inform the evaluation of policies and interventions with potential to address local health gaps. In this paper, we present the set of indicators identified as drivers of urban health inequities within the City of Lisbon, exploring the added value of using a spatial indicator framework together with a participation process to orient a placebased assessment and to inform policies aimed at reducing health inequities. Two workshops with a panel of local stakeholders from health and social care services, municipal departments (e.g. urban planning, environment, social rights and education) and nongovernmental and community-based organizations were organized. The aim was to engage local stakeholders to identify locally critical situations and select indicators of health determinants from a spatial equity perspective. To support the analysis, a matrix of 46 indicators of health determinants, with data disaggregated at the city neighbourhood scale, was constructed and was complemented with maps. The panel identified critical situations for urban health equity in 28 indicators across eight intervention axes: economic conditions, social protection and security; education; demographic change; lifestyles and behaviours; physical environment; built environment; road safety and healthcare resources and performance. The geographical distribution of identified critical situations showed that all 24 city neighbourhoods presented one or more problems. A group of neighbourhoods systematically perform worse in most indicators from different intervention axes, requiring not only priority action but mainly a multi-and intersectoral policy response. The indicator matrices and maps have provided a snapshot of urban inequities across different intervention axes, making a compelling argument for boosting intersectoral work across municipal departments and local stakeholders in the City of Lisbon. This study, by integrating local evidence in combination with social elements, pinpoints the Introduction Evidence on health inequities between and within cities has been globally documented across all countries and regions, regardless of the level of economic development and health system organization [1] [2] [3] [4] . The places where people live within a city and how that city is governed can shape individual and population health and create inequities [5, 6] . There is ample evidence that health inequities have a spatial footprint, often following the geographical patterns of inequality in the social, economic, built and physical environmental conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age-the so-called social determinants of health (SDoH) [1, 7] . These conditions are not distributed randomly within a city, the result of which creates different living conditions, degrees of vulnerability, levels of exposure to environmental risks and hazards, levels of access to resources, services and amenities and the populations' chances of living a flourishing life [1, [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

Examples of this include access to education, economic opportunities, social protection, safety, healthcare, social services, culture, sports and recreation, provision of housing, air and water quality, public transport, green spaces and healthy food [9, [14] [15] [16] . For this reason, resulting inequities are considered both multidimensional and a complex problem: there are multiple contributors and multiple solutions, and these can neither be viewed in isolation nor understood without being situated in their place and local context [10, 17] . While healthcare policy can go some of the way, when it comes to addressing the causes of urban health inequities, gains can only be achieved via the engagement and actions of other sectors. Local and municipal governments play a very important role, not only by having the capacity to effect change through policies and interventions to address problems locally and allocate or redress the inequitable distribution of resources, but also due to their ability to work across sectors and with local stakeholders [14, [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

In this context, it is important to note the work that the WHO Healthy Cities Movement has been developing over the last 30 years to put health on the social, economic and political agendas of city governments across the globe. Embedded is the recognition that more effective initiatives to address health inequities require a shift of paradigm in health promotion: we must reduce \"the focus on individual behavior change interventions within settings and focus more on interventions which change the structure of setting themselves as this is what constitutes action on broader determinants of health inequities\" 24(p138) .",

Data is gathered from area-level indicators to capture geographical inequalities, with readily available data representative at the neighbourhood scale [33, 35, 39, 59, 60] ; (iv) Data quality and validity: the selection of indicators is based on readily available and timely data at the local level, obtained from official and accurate data sources that report current rather than historic data [58, 59] ; (v) Policy-relevant and action oriented: indicators need to be linked to policies and interventions with potential to effect change at the local level. Indicators provide information that is understood by those responsible for taking action and are considered appropriate and useful for guiding local decision-making. Data is spatially disaggregated at the neighbourhood level to inform place-based and multisectoral action [28, 39, 58, 59] ; (vi) Stakeholder engagement: a range of stakeholders from a variety of backgrounds must be involved, as local knowledge is considered vital, alongside with data, when it comes to both identifying and analysing context-specific urban health inequities. The engagement of key players includes local government, healthcare services and local associations and community groups. The objective is not necessarily to reach mutual consensus or to come to a joint decision on what the priority interventions will be, given that it is the policymakers who ultimately hold the final authority and are held accountable for final decisions [47, 58, 59] .; (vii) Participation and collaborative process: the participatory process is designed to promote shared understanding about urban health inequities while capturing multiple stakeholders' values and perspectives, creating a collaborative environment that enables management of eventual conflicts of values and promote agreement. The aim is to create a joint learning experience as a means of creating space for all stakeholders to express their views [45, 46, 48, 61] . (viii) Output validity: the outputs must be considered valid, that is, able to reflect what it is intended to reflect as relevant and meaningful for the specific context of evaluation and local situation (contextual validity), by the group of stakeholders actively engaged in the participatory process (participatory validity). Here, validation is assessed through \"face validity\" [62] , that is, in the view of the evidence presented (indicator data) and the variety of perspectives, the group considers that the indicators selected provide a general picture and are representative of the main drivers of urban health inequities (intersubjective and content validity). Additionally, the process must increase empathy among the participants (empathy validity) [59, 62, 63] .",

However, changes in the governance structure and policymaking process that incorporate health equity considerations in city plans are dependent upon strong political will and commitment. Fig. 7 Geographical distribution of identified critical situations by intervention axis, in the municipality of Lisbon. Note: Civil parishes are coloured using a monochromatic colour scheme with a gradient ranging from light red to dark red according to the number of indicators identified by the majority as a critical situation. Civil parishes in light red were marked as critical in less than 25% of the indicators selected in the intervention axis. Civil parishes in dark red were marked as critical in more than 75% of the selected indicators. Civil parishes in white were not marked red for any indicator of the intervention axis.",

Indicators used in the Lisbon case study can be identified as examples of indicators of relevance to urban areas such as those relating to socioeconomic conditions and physical and built environment. As an example, similarities can be found with the WHO Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool-Urban HEART, where the urban health assessment departs from an indicator matrix with data disaggregated at the neighbourhood level [29] .

The results show that some civil parishes systematically perform worse in most of the indicators when compared with the others, thus becoming a priority for intervention. Critical situations were identified in 28 indicators covering a wide range of health determinants (e.g. social and economic, built and physical environment) linked to the action of many municipal departments and ones that can be addressed by city plans.
