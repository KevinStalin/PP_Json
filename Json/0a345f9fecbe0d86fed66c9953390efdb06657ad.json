The British Medical Association (BMA) [42] produced a detailed guidance directed to those who manage staff (line manager, general practitioner employer, senior member staff), in order to identify healthcare workers who are struggling and prevent this from happening. According to a BMA charter for mental wellbeing [45] , employers are advised to build a supportive culture, develop a wellbeing strategy, create healthy workplaces, tackle the stigma around mental ill-health, foster peer support, ensure support services are accessible and of high-quality, and ensure services have the confidence of those they are intended to help.",
