Several case series with data on ventilator variables from small cohorts have been reported (1-4). However, differences in respiratory mechanics between those with early mortality and successful extubation have not been explored. In this study, we report physiologic and clinical information from a large group of patients with COVID-19 during the first week of mechanical ventilation.",

Daily briefings were held with critical care leadership to inform best practices as patient load increased. Volumecontrolled ventilation was suggested as first choice with a target tidal volume of 6-8 cc/kg of ideal body weight and a plateau pressure <30 cm H 2 O (5). Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was selected by the treating physicians. Neuromuscular blockade was suggested for patients with severe hypoxemia or ongoing ventilator dyssynchrony. Prone positioning was suggested if the partial pressure of O 2 :fraction of inspired O 2 (P:F) ratio remained under 150 despite optimization of ventilator settings over the first 48 hours. Pressure-targeted ventilation was considered if patients experienced dyssynchrony when sedation was weaned.",

Set fraction of inspired oxygen, plateau pressure, extrinsic PEEP, set tidal volume, and minute ventilation were recorded. In patients treated with pressure-targeted ventilation, the distending pressure was used to estimate a plateau pressure. Volumetric capnography was not available; therefore, a surrogate of dead space, called the ventilatory ratio, was used (6) . The ventilatory ratio is an independent predictor of survival in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6, 7) . We compared the distributions of each individual parameter at Days 1 and 3 between those who remained intubated, those successfully extubated, and those who died. We also examined changes over the three time points across the total cohort. We compared the distributions of each individual variable using nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis tests, with a false discovery rate correction for multiple testing. All analyses were performed using R (version 3.6.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, https://www.R-project.org/). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Weill Cornell Medicine with a waiver of informed consent (no. 20-04021909). Data are presented as median (interquartile range). Table 1 summarizes demographics, comorbidities, and intensive care unit treatments for this cohort. A total of 267 patients had ventilator data available. The median age was 66 (54-74) years, and men made up 72% of the cohort. Bilateral infiltrates were present on the first available chest film in 86% of patients. A total of 108 (40%) patients was treated with prone positioning, and 161 (60%) patients were treated with neuromuscular blockade during the course of mechanical ventilation. During the observed time period, 77 patients were successfully extubated and 49 died. Among the 140 remaining intubated, the median duration of mechanical ventilation was 18 (14-24) days.",

Rather, patients with ARDS have diverse pathology, and the syndrome's definition is used to identify eligibility for therapeutic trials. In this cohort, the baseline extrinsic PEEP, driving pressure, and static compliance were similar to ARDS Network trials, and the recent worldwide observational study, LUNGSAFE (Large observational study to UNderstand the Global impact of Severe Acute respiratory FailurE) (10) (11) (12) . However, the variability of the respiratory compliance is considerable, as 25% of patients have a compliance greater than 38 ml/cm H 2 O, which suggests significant heterogeneity. The duration of mechanical ventilation was prolonged in those that remained intubated, which is longer than in other studies of ARDS (10). Surprisingly, there were no observed differences between those with early mortality compared with those that remained intubated or were successfully extubated in this cohort. However, on Day 3, increasing minute ventilation and ventilatory ratio were seen in those who died, along with a P:F ratio that failed to improve. These findings suggest the potential for differential patient trajectories within this disease.",

Moreover, the majority of patients in this cohort were still receiving mechanical ventilation at the time of this analysis. A more definitive comparison of COVID-19 respiratory failure with other forms of ARDS would require rigorous comparison with a contemporary control group. Our analysis of respiratory system compliance does not account for the effects of PEEP titration. Moreover, we lack volumetric capnography, and therefore cannot assess the effects of metabolic rate on gas exchange. We would expect that metabolic rate would vary greatly during fever and neuromuscular blockade (13) . A more complete characterization of gas exchange in COVID-19 would require direct measurement of the dead space and shunt fraction. Another limitation of our study is the incomplete standardization of ventilator practice without the use of a formal PEEP titration table.",

Recently a strong argument in defense of an evidence-based approach was made in AnnalsATS (1), and we fully support the given line of reasoning. Most patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with severe COVID-19 meet the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and proven therapies for ARDS not related to COVID-19 are likely effective in these patients as well. However, ARDS is known to be a heterogeneous syndrome. Over the past decade, several biological, physiological, and morphological subphenotypes have been identified that may predict treatment effects and can be used as treatable traits (2) . For example, patients with a focal lung morphology seem to respond better to prone positioning, but their lungs are not as recruitable as those of patients with a nonfocal lung morphology (3).It has been postulated that patients with COVID-19-related ARDS can develop typical ARDS (recently called \"H type,\" characterized by high elastance, high shunt, and high lung weight) or have an atypical presentation (recently called \"L type,\" characterized by low elastance, low shunt, and low lung weight) (4). As with the abovementioned morphological subphenotypes, some investigators have speculated that these subphenotypes require different ventilator strategies. Patients with H-type ARDS may benefit from lower tidal volumes and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and patients with L-type ARDS may benefit from higher tidal volumes and lower PEEP (5) .Several steps have to be taken before subphenotypedirected treatment can be implemented in clinical practice (6) . The ultimate test would be a head-to-head comparison of subphenotype-directed treatment with standard of care in a randomized controlled trial. But before this step can be considered, it is important to validate the basic assumptions underlying the subclassification of patients. We hypothesized that patients with a low elastance (i.e., with a high respiratory system ",
