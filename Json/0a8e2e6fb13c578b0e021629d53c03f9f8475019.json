On specific platforms, namely, Twitter and Instagram, there exists a wide range of individuals from across the globe who actively discuss topics as they are developing. Twitter has been shown, in certain spheres, to have a more academic lens through which emerging topics are discussed and posted. 1 Other platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook, tend to be centered around personalized stories and are community based. 2 The use of social media has been rising globally, and thus, social media may allow for a holistic view of how topics affect the world, although conversations continue to be dominated by higherincome countries. 3 Moreover, the ability to identify trends in a rapid fashion and how they change over time further corroborates the use of social media analyses within the medical community. While data have been published in survey form on the basis of an evaluation of the impact to cancer surgery from the perspective of surgical oncologists, there is a need to evaluate the impact on and perspectives of the wider surgical cancer community. 4, 5 The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has drastically altered the face of society, including medicine, across the globe from its initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 to its eventual evolution into a global pandemic. Surgeries have been canceled, treatment plans have been altered, and delays are present across nearly all specialties. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] The ability to provide surgical cancer care during this pandemic has affected many, as reflected through social media. The primary focus of this study was to perform a cross-sectional, observational study to Author affiliations and support information (if applicable) appear at the end of this article.",

In terms of author type, eight representative categories were chosen: patient, patient's friends and family, business, news organization, nurse, physician, academic organization or institution, and other. For post content, posts were allocated to one or more of 15 representative categories. Categories were chosen through review of previous social media analysis of medical topics and discussion among the authors. For example, if a post discussed both the cancellation of surgery and the receipt of treatment alone, it was recorded as such. Engagement was recorded by the number of likes, retweets, and hashtags present with each post as of the review date (May 17, 2020). Location data were collected through the evaluation of tagged geographic data as well as through a thorough review of the author biographies.

Physicians who discussed the return to surgery highlighted the need for personal protective equipment and updated guidelines as well as simply the need for cancer surgery to continue because it is overwhelmingly considered as essential from both the provider and the patient perspective. 13, 14 The return to clinics must be addressed in a safe, efficient, and quick manner because cancellations and the return to surgery were emphasized by all cohorts in our study. 15 Research articles (93; 9.3%) and educational information (211; 21.2%) on the COVID-19 pandemic made up approximately one third of the overall discussion surrounding cancer care, surgeries, and coronavirus.

            "text": "To our knowledge, patient perceptions on cancer surgical care during the era of COVID-19 have not been studied. There exists research on surgical oncologists and how COVID-19 has affected their practices and their ability to treat disease 16 ; however, no prior study combines these two important perspectives. While social media allows an immediate view into concerns and desires of patients, providers, and organizations, additional research may be able to more directly address this issue as highlighted here. 17 Another topic mentioned in 51 (5.6%) of the 996 included tweets was the delay of cancer diagnoses. An important difference exists between these tweets and those of patients who had their surgeries canceled or delayed. In those in whom surgeries were delayed or canceled, presumably a treatment plan is in place. Although delayed or pushed out for multiple months, in many cases, the diagnosis is known and the risks are discussed when canceling surgeries. In addition, many patients with cancer can be offered effective alternatives to immediate surgery; for example, many patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer were given preoperative endocrine therapy during the pandemic as a bridge to surgery in the future. However, patients with undiagnosed cancer who delay presentation because of COVID-19 lockdowns, hospital policies, or a general fear of contracting the virus are at risk for delayed diagnoses and treatments and worse cancer outcomes. This situation has been studied for patients with acute coronary syndrome and stroke 18 ; however, to our knowledge, no study has been published with regard to cancer diagnoses. One father advocated for his son to receive a COVID-19 test despite being asymptomatic so that he might be screened for cancer after finding a lump; another woman in the United Kingdom feared the ramifications of people worried about going to their doctor in terms of cancer diagnoses. While cancellations must be addressed, so too must patient fears of contracting the virus from normal checkups and screenings.",

Social media data analyses inherently have limitations as well, with the possibility of oversimplification of complex topics through the use of built-in analytic tools. Using a social media analysis to elucidate trends may not represent the broader opinions of groups of patients, their families, and physicians as well as organizations as a whole.",

Given our short period of study and the rapidly changing environment and discussion around COVID-19, the peak of discussion may not have been captured in different locations, thus limiting our scope. In addition, the use of two hashtags further limits this data set and decreases the ability for trends to be generalized to all cancer surgical care in the era of COVID-19. Finally, our results may not be representative of all age-groups because Twitter use tends to be among younger cohorts. 21 In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally altered the administration of cancer care across the globe. Analysis of a focused subset of social media allows for a detailed view of individuals' perceptions in the cancer community with regard to emerging issues presented by COVID-19. In this cross-sectional analysis of a single social media platform during the month of April 2020, trends within the discussion of cancer care during the pandemic were elucidated. The cancellation of surgeries was of particular concern for patients, although all categories of authors emphasized this as well. Physicians began discussing return to surgery as well as the need for cancer surgery to continue to occur. Other topics such as education surrounding COVID-19, noncancelled cancer surgeries, and having COVID-19 while recovering in the hospital were also highlighted among authors. These findings provide an indicative sampling of fundamental perceptions of COVID-19 within cancer care and surgeries.",

Patients within the cohort focused on the cancellation of their surgeries 46.5% (40 of 86) of the time, and physicians posted about cancellation 33.4% of the time. Posts often had a fearful or angry tone about the cancellation of surgeries. One individual from the United States was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at the beginning of March and had her surgery postponed indefinitely because of COVID-19 concerns. Another individual from South Africa posted frustration with the cancellation of melanoma resection and chemotherapy course, stating \"If I don't die from a virus, I will certainly die from untreated cancer.\"Others focused on what is truly nonessential and how difficult this definition can be. In our analysis of the Twitter posts, the pandemic has left both physicians and patients with numerous cancellations and delays, an unacceptable position for many.",
