            "text": "The second wave of COVID-19 in Malaysia is largely attributed to a mass gathering held in Sri Petaling between February 27, 2020 and March 1, 2020, which contributed to an exponential rise of COVID-19 cases in the country. Starting March 18, 2020, the Malaysian government introduced four consecutive phases of a Movement Control Order (MCO) to stem the spread of COVID-19. The MCO was implemented through various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The reported number of cases reached its peak by the first week of April and then started to reduce, hence proving the effectiveness of the MCO. To gain a quantitative understanding of the effect of MCO on the dynamics of COVID-19, this paper develops a class of mathematical models to capture the disease spread before and after MCO implementation in Malaysia. A heterogeneous variant of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model is developed with additional compartments for asymptomatic transmission. Further, a change-point is incorporated to model the before and after disease dynamics, and is inferred based on data. Related statistical analyses for inference are developed in a Bayesian framework and are able to provide quantitative assessments of (1) the impact of the Sri Petaling gathering, and (2) the extent of decreasing transmission during the MCO period. The analysis here also quantitatively demonstrates how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI implemention within a short time period.",

The parameters that govern the trajectory of the SEIR model are \u03b8 \u2261 (\u03b2, \u03b4, \u03b3, i 0 , e 0 ) which are, respectively, the transmission rate (i.e., number of individuals in the population an infected person comes in contact with and successfully transmits the disease per unit time), the rate of incubation of the disease, the rate of infectiousness, the initial number of infectives and the initial number of exposed individuals. Since\u1e60(t) +\u0116(t) +\u0130(t) +\u1e58(t) = 0, it follows that S(t) + E(t) + I(t) + R(t) = N for all t.

The window to the right of T * is denoted by W R which consists of dates after T * up to and including April 28th, 2020. The change-point date T * is inferred from data; it is not taken as March 18th, 2020, the date of the start of MCO. Choosing T * in this data-driven way is justified as the impact of MCO on observed cases may not be realized immediately. The modified SEIR model with change-point T * is governed by the ODE system (6)-(12) for all time points t \u2208 W L . For t \u2208 W R , the same ODE system (6)-(12) is considered but now with a different set of parameter values in W R compared to W L , and with a new \u03b2 o expressed as a function of t, The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is defined as the number of secondary infections caused by one primary individual during his/her infectious period.

In fact, several studies in the literature report a gradual decrease in R 0 after lockdown [22, 23, 24] . For the SEIR model in (1) -(4), R 0 is given by the well-known formula R 0 = \u03b2/\u03b3. Time-varying measures of secondary infections per primary infected, R t , are also available in the literature. However, for the modified SEIR model presented in Section 2.3, R 0 and R t cannot be computed. Therefore, we resort to an alternative quantitative assessement of disease spread -the total number of infections (i.e., generational) caused by the introduction of one additional infectious individual into the infection process at time point t. This procedure is illustrated using the I o compartment. Based on (6)-(12), new values for the ODE system are calculated from time point t onwards with current state values serving as initializations of the ODE system for all except one compartment: For the I o -compartment, the current value I o (t) is replaced by I o (t) + 1/N as the initial value. The new rate of incidence is given by h(S * , I * o , I * c ) over the infectious period of the individual when the ODE system is propagated using (6)",

The virus then incubates within these individuals for some 138 time.

A key difference of the model 199 formulation in (6) -(12) is the power transmission dynamics used to model heterogeneity 200 in the population; see [5, 6]. In [6], a gamma distribution is elicited on the varying 201 disease transmission parameters within the population which gives rise to the powers w s , 202 w i,o and w i,c on S(t), I o (t) and I c (t), respectively, with w s \u2265 1, w i,o \u2265 1 and w i,c \u2265 1.203 The lower bounds on w s , w i,o and w i,c recover the original SEIR model dynamics with 204 no heterogeneity. The remaining parameters have the following interpretation: (1) \u03b1 205 represents a small yet significant force of infection that starts the local infection process 206 but is eventually overwhelmed by it. In our context, \u03b1 represents the initial force of 207 infection arising from, say, foreign infectious individuals attending the large gathering 208 at Sri Petaling starting February 27th. (2) The parameters \u03b3 o and \u03b3 c have the same 209 interpretation as \u03b3 in (3), that is, they are rates of infectiousness but for the observed and 210 cryptic compartments, respectively. (3) The parameter \u03b4 is the same as before, namely, it 211 is the rate of incubation associated with the exposed compartment. (4) The parameters 212 \u03b2 o and \u03b2 c are transmission rates for the observed and cryptic compartments, respectively, 213 in the modified SEIR model with \u03b2 c = \u00b5 \u03b2 0 and \u00b5 \u2208 [0, 1]. In other words, we assume that 214 the transmission rate for asymptomatic individuals is smaller than that of symptomatic 215 individuals; this is a plausible assumption to make as asymptomatic individuals generally 216 possess a lower viral load which leads to lower chances of a successful transmission. On 217 the other hand, a longer asymptomatic infectious period may compensate for the lower 218 transmission rates for an asymptomatic individual, and this possibility is captured by the 219 model via the parameter \u03b3 c .",

Thus, c\u03b3 o represents the residual disease 223 transmission that may be present even during the MCO period, for example, due to close 224 contact between family members in the same household. The general functional form of 225 \u03b2 o (t) subsumes the constant disease transmission rate model as a special case by taking 226 a 1 = c = 0 in (13). The constant rate submodel has the advantage of not explicitly 227 assuming any functional form for the change in disease transmission over time. On the 228 other hand, it can only ascertain if there is an overall change (increase or decrease) in 229 transmission after the change point T * . Similar to the relationship \u03b2 c = \u00b5\u03b2 o in W L , we 230 assume \u03b2 c (t) = \u00b5 \u03b2 o (t) for the window W R based on a different \u00b5 value.

In 254 what follows, we describe the priors used on the generic parameter \u03b8 after which the 255 discussion on prior elicitation can be extended to \u03b8 (L) and \u03b8 (R) in a straightforward man-256 ner. It is important to note that the priors on \u03b8 depend on hyperparameters. Here, 257 we only elicit the forms of the priors; the discussion on the exact choice of the corre-258 sponding hyperparameters is relegated to the next few paragraphs. Independent uniform 259 priors U (a \u03be 1 , b \u03be 1 ) are chosen for each \u03be 1 \u2208 {\u00b5, p, w i,o , w i,c , w s , \u03b1} with corresponding hy-260 perparameters a \u03be 1 and b \u03be 1 . The prior on (\u03b3 o , \u03b4) is chosen independently in the following 261 way: For \u03be 2 \u2208 {\u03b3 o , \u03b4}, 1/\u03be 2 \u223c U (a \u03be 2 , b \u03be 2 ). The reciprocal transformation is used for prior 262 elicitation since these parameters have a rate interpretation, and hence, their reciprocals 263 represent the corresponding duration (either incubation or infectious periods) with bench-264 mark values reported in the literature [16, 17, 18, 27]. The cryptic infectious period 1/\u03b3 c 265 is generally longer than the observed infectious period 1/\u03b3 o (since the former remains 266 undetected). Hence, it follows that 1/\u03b3 o < 1/\u03b3 c . This restriction can be incorporated into 267 the prior elicitation for 1/\u03b3 o and 1/\u03b3 c by first generating 1/\u03b3 o \u223c U (a \u03b3o , b \u03b3o ) as above and 268 then setting 1/\u03b3 c = 1/\u03b3 o + \u03be 3 where \u03be 3 \u223c U (a \u03be 3 \u2261 0, b \u03be 3 > 0).

Our prior elicitation adopts 274 this reparametrization for the following reason: For \u03b2 o = e a 0 \u03b3 o , the basic reproduction 275 number R 0 \u2261 e a 0 is the more fundamental quantity for simpler models, such as the SIR 276 and SEIR models, compared to \u03b2 o . Thus, R 0 for these models can be benchmarked based 277 on similar flu-like epidemics in the past which, in turn, provide a suggested range of 278 values for the prior elicitation of a 0 in W L ; see [28]. Note that \u03b2 o which represents the 279 contact rate of the target population cannot be determined by direct observation. Hence, 280 putting a prior directly on \u03b2 o is difficult. Similarly, since 1/\u03b3 o is the observed infectious 281 period, benchmark values can be obtained from the literature for its prior elicitation. To 282 summarize, we put direct priors on parameters that have an epidemiological interpretation 283 and which can be benchmarked from reported literature for eliciting the appropriate prior.284For W R , \u03b2 o (t) has the form in (13) for coefficients a 0 , a 1 and c. For a 0 , we consider two 285 cases: When using the submodel to determine whether an overall reduction in transmission 286 occurs or not, we take a 0 \u223c U (L a 0 , U a 0 ) with L a 0 < 0 and U a 0 > 0. If the full model of (13) 287 is considered, a 0 is chosen deterministically to ensure continuity of the infection process 288 before and after the change-point. More specifically, a 0 in W R is chosen so that the rate289 of incidence h(S(t), I o (t), I c (t)) in W L and W R coincide at t = T * . For the full model, a 1 290 is given a uniform prior with support on [L a 1 , U a 1 ].

Daily cumulative cases and the curve of R o (t) 335 are displayed in Figure 6. We note from these figures that the proposed model captures 336 broad features of the observed data and is an improvement over the constant rate sub-337 model. Uncertainty estimates are obtained for all unknown parameters in \u0398 based on the 338 ensemble {\u0398 * i } M * i=1 . Variabilility estimates can be obtained for all parameters and their 339 functions. As an illustration, we demonstrate the extent of variability inherent in the 340 posterior visually for the expected R o (t) curve given by \u03b3 o I o (t) (see (16)) for t \u2208 [T 0 , T 1 ]. 341 This is displayed in Figure 7 which shows that most of the reported case numbers are 342 well within the limits of variability of the posterior. Hence, the proposed model together 343 with the negative binomial likelihood are able to explain the variability in the reported 344 case numbers. However, there are a few exceptions, the most notable being the reported 345 case number on Day 14 for Malaysia in Figure 7(a). We present an explanation for this 346 outlying case later in the Discussion section. 347 Further results from the Bayesian analyses are summarized in Tables 1, 2 and 3. These 348 tables give the MAP estimates of parameters and their corresponding 95% credible in-349 tervals for Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak, respectively. We provide a summary of the 350 salient findings here. The symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious periods as well as the 351 incubation periods are found to be around 6-8 days for Malaysia, Selangor and Sarawak. 352 These findings are similar to values reported in the literature for other countries; see, 353 for example, [16, 17, 18, 27]. Change-points T * are estimated not too far away from the 354 date of MCO implementation, March 18th 2020. For Malaysia, T * = 18 is the MAP es-355 timate which corresponds to March 19th, 2020, and the associated 95% credible interval 356 is (17, 21). For Selangor, the MAP estimate of T * is T * = 22 with (17.5, 25) being the 357 95% credible interval. For Sarawak, the transition date is less precise. The MAP estimate 358 is T * = 25 (March 26th 2020) but the 95% credible interval (18, 32.5) is much larger 359 indicating higher uncertainty in T * . This can be attributed to the fact that the trajectory 360 of reported case numbers for Sarawak shows a slower and more gradual increase, then 361 Country/State Window Parameter MAP 95% Credible Interval Malaysia W L",

The 433 MCO implementation is found to be highly effective in containing (an exponential rise 434 of) the COVID-19 outbreak in Malaysia. The analysis here quantitatively demonstrates 435 how quickly transmission rates fall under effective NPI implemention within a short time 436 period. Higher disease transmission is found in Selangor (a state with higher population 437 density) compared to Sarawak. We also found that under MCO, the decline in transmis-438 sion was faster in Selangor compared to Sarawak. The rise and fall of disease transmission 439 in Selangor mirrored the national level whereas Sarawak showed a more gradual increase 440 and decrease in COVID-19 transmission. The change points were mostly found to be 441 close to the date of MCO implementation (18th March 2020) although Sarawak exhib-442 ited a larger uncertainty around that date due to its gradual and slower increasing and 443 decreasing trends of reported case numbers. Our study developed a new model to rep-444 resent COVID-19 spread in Malaysia that accounts for heterogeneity and asymptomatic 445 transmissions. We found that reported case numbers in Malaysia exhibited large vari-446 abilities which can possibly be attributed to a delay in reporting, particularly during the 447 early stages of the pandemic as the experience with handling COVID-19 was new to the 448 country. Nevertheless, the model developed here together with the overdispersed negative 449 binomial likelihood are able to capture salient features of COVID-19 spread in Malaysia 450 and provide reliable quantitative assessments even under the challenges of limited and 451 delayed data. 452 23 All rights reserved.

For COVID-19 in particular, the onset of symptoms does not necessarily indicate the start of infectiousness; in fact, the onset of infectiousness may be somewhat earlier. Thus, the infectious period 1/\u03b3 represents the period of effective infectiousness, that is, the period from the start of infectiousness (asymptomatic or symptomatic) until the individual is isolated and then can no longer infect others. Based on this understanding, 1/\u03b4 represents the incubation period, which is the period starting 162 from getting infected until the onset of infectiousness.
