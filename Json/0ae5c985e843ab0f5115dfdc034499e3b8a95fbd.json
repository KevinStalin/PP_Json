Approximately 74% of the TDMVCL MAURITIUS accrued to persons aged between 20 and 59 years. Reanalysis of the model with 5 and 10% discount rates, holding national life expectancy constant, reduced the TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 19.0 and 45.5%, respectively. Application of the average world life expectancy at 3% discount rate reduced TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 13%; and use of the world highest life expectancy at 3% discount rate increased TDMVCL MAURITIUS by 50%.",

Brazil (7) , Canada (8), China (9) , France (10), Iran (11) , Italy (12), Spain (13) , Turkey (14) , the United Kingdom [UK] (15) , and the USA (16) are exceptions. Quantifying the real disease burden of COVID-19 in dollar terms is critical to building advocacy to increase investment into health-related systems. The objectives of this paper are 2-fold. First, to estimate the discounted money value of human life losses associated with COVID-19 in Mauritius as of 16 October 2020. Secondly, to estimate briefly the potential gains from preventive actions taken to contain the spread of COVID- 19. Mauritius is among the very few countries in the WAFR which has managed to halt the community transmission of COVID- 19 . There have been no confirmed cases of local transmission since 26 April 2020. The success might be attributed to four systemic reasons.",

Table 2 shows that, except for the Zoonotic and humananimal interface, all the other 12 IHR core capacity scores for Mauritius were higher than those for the WAFR (34) . The average of the 13 IHR core capacities score of 64 was higher than the average for WAFR of 44. Despite the past relative success, the Ministry of Health and Wellness acknowledges the need to sustain advocacy for increased and efficiently utilized investments to bridge the albeit limited persisting gaps in UHC and implementation of some of the IHR core capacities (35) . Card and Mooney (36) argue that given the resources available in any health system for saving life are limited, rational allocation of resources is needed, which call for monetary valuation of human life. According to Rice (37) , it is important to translate adverse effects of diseases, such as COVID-19, into dollar terms which is the universal language of decisionmakers in ministries of economic development, planning, and finance; the private sector; and the international development policy arena.",

These included bans on public gatherings, a curfew order, closing of borders, discontinuation of public transportation; closing of schools, universities, shopping malls, and tourist sites; suspending of employee attendance at government and private workplaces (except for essential staff); and introduction of mass testing for antigens on 27 April 2020.

            "text": "Why use net GDP per capita, i.e., the difference between GDP per capita and health care expenditure per capita? Economic theory assumes that every rational individual strives to maximize utility (happiness or pleasure or welfare). The main direct determinants of utility are the consumption of health, nonhealth goods and services, and leisure (50) . Individuals demand health because it is intrinsically pleasurable, allows one to engage in activities of daily living (e.g., schooling, work), and enables one to enjoy leisure activities (e.g., eating and drinking in restaurants, local and international tourism activities, sports, socializing, visiting drama and movie theaters, sports). People demand health goods and services, which do not yield utility, because of the expected positive impact on health, i.e., healthrelated-quality of life and length of life. Thus, the demand for health goods and services is derived from the demand for health (51) . COVID-19 illness (or any other illness) compels individuals (and households) to pay for health goods and services, which reduces household disposable income, and hence, enjoyment of leisure activities and non-health goods and services that directly deliver utility (or pleasure) (49) . It is for this reason that WHO (50) recommends: \". . . it is important to note that GDP includes expenditure on health goods and services, so this component should be omitted, and the focus of analysis be redirected toward establishing the present value of discounted aggregate flows of current and future consumption of non-health-related goods and services linked to disease (p.4)\".",
