SARS-CoV-2 infection in Spain has shown a heterogeneous geographical pattern This study aimed to assess the influence of several climatic factors on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19 among the Spanish Autonomous Communities (AA.CC.). Methods: Data on coronavirus infectivity and severity of COVID-19 disease, as well as the climatic variables were obtained from official sources (Ministry of Health and Spanish Meteorological Agency, respectively). To assess the possible influence of climate on the development of the disease, data on ultraviolet radiation (UVR) were collected during the months before the start of the pandemic. To analyze its influence on the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, data on UVR, temperature, and humidity were obtained from the months of highest contagiousness to the peak of the pandemic.",

The appearance of the initial cases in China during the wintertime and the extraordinary spread of the infection during this period of the year are noted first [2] . Secondly, epidemics caused by other coronaviruses including SARS-CoV also occur during the winter months [3, 4] . In this sense, the fast spread of viral infection around the world, especially in temperate climates, resembles the similar seasonal pattern of other respiratory viral epidemics [5, 6] . Finally, based on epidemiologic models, a theoretical new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection would be expected during the autumn/winter of 2020-2021 [7, 8] .",

In fact, data on the influence of both temperature and humidity, reveals a clear association between these climatic parameters and virus survival and infectivity [9, 10] . Other factors, such as the amount of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), have not been explored in detail for SARS-CoV-2, but might be also critical to explain the epidemiological characteristics of this infection, as occur with other viral diseases [11, 12] . Although these environmental factors are not modifiable, some host defense mechanisms can interact or be directly related to them. In this regard, UVR has been used as a surrogate marker of vitamin D status in multiple studies [1, 13] , and low UVR during the wintertime has been associated with the seasonal pattern of several viral infections [13, 14] . Vitamin D is a hormone related to multiple effects on the innate and acquired immune system and also involved in the proper production of antimicrobial peptides [13, 15] . Furthermore, there is some evidence to support the use of vitamin D supplements for the prevention of influenza or other respiratory viral infections [16] .",

Here, we show data that provide a clue to understanding one of the main environmental parameters, such as climatic conditions. Thus, regardless of other relevant factors, we found that low UVR in the months preceding the pandemic could explain, at least in part, the differences in the infectivity and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection across the different Spanish regions. The possible influence of UVR in the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection might be related to the selection of patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Spain, although the role of sun exposure should not be discarded. In fact, UVR is the main source of vitamin D (13) , and it is tempting to speculate that vitamin D deficiency could predispose individuals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Without a high dietary (or supplemental) intake of vitamin D, sun exposure is essential to avoid vitamin D insufficiency. Furthermore, previous studies suggest that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels are associated with an increased risk of acute respiratory infections in a dose-dependent manner and irrespective of age [22] . The accumulated UVR before starting the pandemic was not only associated with the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection but also significantly related to the severity of the disease, in terms of hospitalization and ICU admission. In Spain, the majority of serious cases have affected Fig. 3 Relationship between climatic factors and infectivity across the Spanish AA.CC grouped according to tertiles of cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2. Data on UVR (J/m 2 ), temperature (\u00b0C), and relative humidity (%) were collected from the months with the highest infectivity (February and March 2020). T1, T2, and T3 tertiles refer to AA.CC with low, medium, or high cumulative incidence (previous 14 days) \u00d7 10 5 inhabitants, of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Statistical differences* (p) in tertiles of the cumulative incidence in the two periods analyzed, for each of the meteorological variables elderly patients, those with associated comorbidities and, with special virulence, nursing home residents (Ministry of Health; https://www.mscbs.gob.es). In a great number of these individuals, serum 25OHD levels are usually low [23] [24] [25] [26] , and therefore might contribute to the exceedingly high COVID-19 severity and lethality they present. Besides, vitamin D deficiency has been found to also contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome [27] , the most frequent severe complication related to COVID-19 mortality [28] . Preliminary data from our group suggests that patients with COVID-19 have especially low levels of circulating 25OHD at hospital admission (data not shown). Although we do not have information on serum 25OHD levels in patients with a mild disease not requiring hospitalization, advice on personal sun exposure or treatment with vitamin D supplements (if needed) might be an easy, cheap and effective option to decrease SARS-CoV-2 impact.",

            "text": "Although low humidity seems to be a more critical environmental factor influencing the outbreak of human coronavirus disease in China [4, 10] , our results in Spain did not show the same pattern. These divergences with the data reported from China may have several explanations. Thus, the narrow range of relative humidity in Spain during this winter might not allow detecting this effect of humidity on the risk of infection. Besides, we do not have data on absolute humidity, which, as some authors have suggested, may be a better indicator of the impact of this climatic variable [19] . As previously stated, this divergence might be the result of differences in temperature or other climatic factors, and also of changes in host behavior induced by the pandemic itself and by the imposed confinement measures. Wintertime in temperate climates is usually linked to more time spent indoors where contacts are closer. Furthermore, the number of people-to-people contacts significantly increases on indoor settings during the progression of the pandemic, especially in hospitals and nursing homes, the two places that include the population hardest hit by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Spain (elderly people and health care workers), while local weather conditions might have minor effects on the contacts. This seasonal and confinement situation also translates into low indoor relative humidity, which might also accelerate the spread of the virus [5] . Finally, contradictory results regarding the influence of climatic factors in other countries have also been obtained with other coronaviruses, such as MERS-SARS [30, 31] . Thus, it could be possible that viral infectivity might change depending on the particular climate conditions of each location.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. Firstly, data on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are obtained from the Spanish Government official sources. This data might underestimate the real data on infection as only patients with more symptomatic and severe manifestations have been tested up to now. However, we consider that this aspect does not influence the findings of this study since the same national policy has been applied in all Spanish regions since the start of the pandemic. Secondly, the number of hospitalizations and ICU admissions are more reliable markers of disease severity, although the inverse association of severity and UVR might also reflect the selection of only moderate to severe COVID-19 symptomatic cases. Nevertheless, the number of deaths might also be underestimated, since many deaths that occur outside of hospitals have probably not been accounted as related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thirdly, epidemiological data might have been affected by the time of interventions since March 13, 2020, when the alarm status was imposed by the Spanish Government. However, it is possible that the confinement of the population did not have a relevant effect on our results of accumulated UVR impact since the analysis was performed with data from April 1, 2020 and, given the incubation period of the disease, the impact on the results has likely been minimal. Thirdly, official climatic data on three regions of Spain (La Rioja, Navarra, and Asturias) were not provided, but we thought that the findings we have presented provide also relevant information as representing more than 95% of the Spanish population. Finally, a possible limitation of the study is that the so-called ecological fallacy may have been committed, that is to failure in reasoning that arises when an inference is made about an individual based on aggregate data for a group. Therefore, the design used serves to propose hypotheses that must be corroborated with other epidemiological designs.",

Thus, meteorological information should be integrated into a future forecast of a potential new outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. If the influence of UVR on circulating serum 25OHD levels in patients with COVID-19 is confirmed, the potential preventive treatment with vitamin D supplementation in high-risk groups for SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in those individuals with vitamin D deficiency, merits further investigation in well-designed randomized controlled trials.",
