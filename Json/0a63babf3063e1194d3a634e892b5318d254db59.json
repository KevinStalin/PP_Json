            "text": "Faecal-oral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS- ) is yet to be validated, but it is a critical issue and additional research is needed to elucidate the risks of the novel coronavirus in sanitation systems. This is the first study that investigates the potential health risks of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage to wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) workers. A quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is applied for three COVID-19 scenarios (moderate, aggressive and extreme) to study the effects of different stages of the pandemic in terms of percentage of infected population on the probability of infection to WWTP workers. A dose-response model for SARS-CoV-1 (as a surrogate pathogen) is assumed in the QMRA for SARS-CoV-2 using an exponential model with k = 4.1 \u00d7 10 2 . Literature data are incorporated to inform assumptions for calculating the viral load, develop the model, and derive a tolerable infection risk. Results reveal that estimates of viral RNA in sewage at the entrance of WWTPs ranged from 4.14x10 1 to 5.23x10 3 GC.mL -1 (viable virus concentration from 0.04 to 5.23 PFU.mL -1 , respectively). In addition, estimated risks for the aggressive and extreme scenarios (2.6x10 -3 and 1.3x10 -2 , respectively) were likely to be above the derived tolerable infection risk for SARS-CoV-2 of 5.5x10 -4 pppy, thus reinforcing the concern of sewage systems as a possible transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2. These findings are helpful as an early health warning tool and in prioritizing upcoming risk management strategies, such as Emergency Response Plans (ERPs) for water and sanitation operators during the COVID-19 and future pandemics.",

            "text": "The primary mechanism of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission is via respiratory droplets that people cough, sneeze or exhale (ECDPC, 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; Domingo et al., 2020) . The virus can survive on different surfaces from several hours up to a few days (Joonaki et al., 2020) , and although its persistence in waters is possible (Gwenzi, 2020) , the stability of its infectivity is not fully understood. Human viruses do not replicate in the environment and the transport of SARS-CoV-2 via the water cycle potentializes its occurrence and persistence in human wastewater catchments, and enhances the possibility of coming in contact with people, most likely via aerosols and airborne particles (Haas, 2020; McLellan at al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Kumar et al., 2020; La Rosa et al., 2020 ). An increasing number of articles on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in faeces of COVID-19 patients, by reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain (RT-qPCR), have been published and were recently reviewed by Kitajima et al. (2020) , Foladori et al. (2020) and Gwenzi, (2020) . Although most literature on the virus detection in stool samples has identified only the viral genetic material (RNA), which does not necessarily mean viability, a few articles have indicated that the virus may remain viable, infectious and/or able to replicate in stool under certain conditions Xiao et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2020b) . The lack of studies and analyses of material with high concentrations of live virus (such as when performing virus propagation, virus isolation or neutralization assays), are likely due to the need for highly skilled staff and procedures equivalent to Biosafety Level 3 (containment laboratory with inward directional airflow) (CDC, 2020a; WHO, 2020b) .",

The possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has many implications, especially in regions with poor sanitation infrastructure, considering the possible entering of SARS-CoV-2 into the sewage and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) . After the first SARS global outbreak of 2003, very little information was available on the presence of SARS-CoV in sewage, with the exception to the study by Wang et al. (2005) , which reported that SARS-CoV could be excreted through the stool/urine of infected patients into the sewage system and remain infectious for 2 days at 20 \u00b0C, but for 14 days at 4 \u00b0C, thus demonstrating the sewage system as possible route of transmission. More, the persistence of two surrogate coronaviruses (transmissible gastroenteritis and mouse hepatitis) has already been reported by Casanova et al. (2009) the two viruses remained infectious in pasteurized settled sewage for days to weeks, with great influence of temperature.",

(2020) published the first report of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in WWTPs, by analyzing (using RT-PCR) sewage samples from seven different cities and from an airport in the Netherlands, during a period before and after the first COVID case reported in that country. The authors showed that no SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples collected three weeks before the first COVID-19 case; meanwhile, the first virus fragment was detected in sewage at five sites, one week after the first COVID-19 case. More recently, Wu et al. (2020) quantified viral titer of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage from a major urban treatment facility in Massachusetts (USA) and suggested approximately 100 viral particles per mL of sewage. In Queensland (Australia), SARS-CoV-2 RNA tested positive (RT-qPCR) in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f two out of nine sewage samples, and quantitative estimation were 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than in Wu\u00b4s investigation . A reasonable assumption for this discrepancy is the much higher number of COVID-19 infected people in the former region and/or different faeces dilution rates along the sewer networks. Corroborating, Foladori et al. (2020) reported that concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage entering a WWTP may vary from 2 copies.100 mL -1 to 3x10 3 copies.mL -1 .",

Accordingly, there is an urgent need for anticipated risk assessment and sanitation interventions in preventing this possible route of transmission and consequences for public health, considering a future confirmation and validation of the virus infectivity hypothesis in such environment (Heller et al., 2020) . This is particularly important in less developed countries, where the occupational exposure for workers in WWTPs may warrant additional concern since the protocols of personal and collective protective equipment (PPE and CPE) use is not as stringent as it is in the developed countries.",

            "text": "Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) is a useful tool that has been used for almost 40 years to estimate human health risks associated with exposures to pathogens in different environmental matrices (Haas et al., 2014) . QMRA has been applied to assess health risks associated with bioaerosols (Carducci et al., 2018) , drinking water (Petterson and Ashbolt, 2016) , reclaimed water (Zaneti et al., 2012ab, 2013 , recreational waters Gularte et al., 2019) , irrigation water (Ezzat, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof 2020), and sewage (Kozak et al., 2020) . Recent publications have encouraged the application of QMRA based on previous studies of relevant respiratory viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, to assess the likelihood of adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 associated with sewage exposure (Haas, 2020; Kitajima et al., 2020) . Zhang et al. (2020b) conducted a QMRA of SARS-CoV-2 in a South China Seafood Market where health risks associated with aerosol transmission were evaluated. The estimated median risk of infection after one hour of exposure in the market was 2.23 \u00d7 10 -5 . Another QMRA considered bioaerosol exposure to adenoviruses at a WWTP (Carducci et al., 2018) . The authors estimated higher average risks associated with exposure to sewage influent and biological oxidation tanks (15.64% and 12.73%, respectively, for an exposure of three minutes). A limitation of conducting a QMRA of SARS-CoV-2 is the lack of dose-response information for this particular coronavirus, thus requiring data related to infectivity of similar viruses be assumed (Kitajima et al., 2020) . Nevertheless, research studies -such as this present QMRA -are important for informing appropriate decisions during this pandemic. According to Kitajima et al. (2020) , QMRA can be used to identify surface disinfection benchmarks for SARS-CoV-2, as well as the best technologies and disinfectants for achieving these targets. Such information will lead to effective health risk mitigation by reducing exposure. Further, according to Pecson et al. (2020) , QMRA studies can identify unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 that may identify concerns regarding existing regulations and approaches to public health protection.",

The results are reported using GC per g of stool or GC per mL of stool and thus, to change units from #/mL to #/g, we used the density of wet human faeces of 1.075 g.mL -1 (Penn et al., 2018) , which resulted in viral loads ranging from 5.4x10 3 to 6.6x10 7 GC.g -1 . Then, to calculate VS (in PFU.mL -1 ), we assumed an average between the minimum and maximum value of 3.3x10 7 GC.g -1 . The value used for AF was 10 -3 , assuming that 10 3 GC corresponds to one (1) plaque forming unit -PFU (Aslan et al. 2011; Mcbride et al., 2013; Carducci et al., 2016) .

(2020) and considered the event of accidental ingestion of sewage by WWTPs workers while performing routine activities. The hazardous exposures were identified by a systematic on-site survey of SJN-WWTP and S-WWTP and their treatment processes and operations. Through interviews with WWTP workers and monitoring of their activities, we identified that during manual cleaning of coarse screening, when a fork is used to remove wastes, exposure of workers to ingestion of droplets is a major hazardous event, especially in windy weather conditions, when there is intense contact of sewage droplets and airborne particles with their faces, particularly if they are not wearing a face shield and mask. Screening is the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f first sewage treatment stage and no reduction in viral particles and/or viral viability of sewage entering the WWTP is expected at this treatment point. The volume ingested considered data reported by Westrell et al. (2004) of 1 mL for worker exposed to the pre-aeration process. The frequency of exposure was considered to be a single event, since the focus of this study is to assess the risks during COVID-19 outbreaks, rather than estimating annual risks. A range of three different scenarios were approached, classified according to the total number of COVID-19 infected people, from lowest to highest, as follows: i. moderate, using local data (Porto Alegre, Brazil); ii. aggressive, using data from Madrid (Spain); and iii. extreme, using data from New York City (USA). The evaluation of these three scenarios was divided in 6 types of exposure, three for each WWTP, carried out to study the effect of different stages of the pandemic in terms of percentage of infected population. For estimating total infected population, we used data of COVID-19 infected and recovered people and deaths from April/2020, and accounted for the underreported cases according to Russell et al. (2020) for New York City and Madrid, and according to UFPEL (2020) for Porto Alegre. The specific values used and sources are described in Table 1 .",

Determining exposure volumes for occupational risks in workplaces such as WWTPs is particularly challenging due to differences in skills and level of experience of workers, the wide range of activities and different levels of protection, as well as seasonal changes. Moreover, there is very little information about the ingestion route during such scenarios. It is generally recognized that accidental ingestion involves the processes of transfer of the substance from the environment into the mouth, and this must include movement of contaminated hands or objects into the mouth, or contact of contaminated hands or objects with the skin around the mouth (the peri-oral area) followed by migration of this contamination into the mouth (Christopher et al. 2006) . Splashing into the mouth or onto the face are also relevant mechanisms, although probably much less important. Haas (2020) highlighted the relative importance of the so-called -fomites\u2016 in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, which consist of larger airborne particles that can deposit on surfaces, where the contained viruses persist for hours to days, and might have a pathway from hands to mouth, nose and eye. Ashbolt et al. (2005) supported that the volume ingested during operational irrigation activities (water intense activity) follow a triangular distribution of (0.1; 1; 2corresponding to min; mode; max, respectively), in mL. Based on that assumption, we have already carried out another risk-based study on accidental reclaimed wastewater J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof ingestion by using the minimum value (0.1 mL) of this triangular distribution in order not to overestimate the risks (Zaneti et al., 2013; Zaneti et al. 2012ab ). On the other hand, the ingestion volume adopted for the proposed exposure pathway in the present study (1 mL in a single event) arose from Westrell et al. (2004) , for workers at a preaeration treatment stage of WWTP, corresponding to the same value of the mode of the aforementioned triangular distribution of Ashbolt et al. (2005) , and thus, not over conservative. Therefore, this approach appears to satisfactorily support the viral loads and doses obtained herein.",

(2018) , there are no occupational exposure limits (OELs) for microbial agents to date and thus, acceptable level of risks has not yet been defined. This can make the decision-making process for managing health risks of SARS-CoV-2 in workplaces such as WWTPs a little more complex. In the risk assessment and risk characterization of drinking water and reclaimed wastewater, risk targets are commonly determined in order to set microbial and toxicological limits and develop mitigation strategies (Dogan et al., 2020) . In the present work, the derived tolerable infection risk pppy for SARS-CoV-2 was equal to 5.5x10 -4 and thus, the estimated risks for the moderate and aggressive scenarios for both WWTPs were higher than this determined value (Table 1 ). The fact that the present study considered the risk of a single exposure and that it was higher than an acceptable annual risk in these two mentioned scenarios, reinforces the concern with the fecal-oral exposure route for SARS-CoV-2insofar as a greater number of WWTP worker exposure events are expected to take place over the course of a year. For this reason, although the estimated risks per exposure event for both WWTPs in the moderate scenario were lower than the tolerable infection risk pppy, it must not be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f neglected. Conversion of the calculated risk of infection related to a single event to the annual risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic is rather complex due to fluctuations in the evolution of the epidemiological curve (Bastos and Cajueiro, 2020; Kissler et al., 2020) , and thus, leading to inaccuracies in estimating sewage viral loads and in calculating the respective risk of infection.",

A laboratory-based study showed the SARS-CoV-2 to be infective in aerosols for as long as 16 hours (Fears et al., 2020) . When considering occurrence in wastewater, Gundy et al. (2009) The present study demonstrated that COVID-19 outbreaks may pose increasing health risks at such workplaces and thus, specific risk management strategies need to be developed. It is highly recommended that WWTP workers that perform manual cleaning of screening use face shields and face masks. At the same time, considering that in most of the emerging countries treatment tanks are not covered in WWTPs, as well as there is no barriers to avoid splashes and sprays as in the developed countries (KDHEKS, 2020; CDC, 2020b; Nghiem et al., 2020) , it is suggested reduction in circulation (frequency and duration) of workers in such areas. Meanwhile, there are research needs to evaluate experimentally bioaerosol and airborne particle risks for WWTP workers and nearby communities. To date, there is no such work available, but research evaluating SARS-CoV-2 concentration at specific points of the sewer catchment, including the WWTP, as a wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) strategy seeking to help public health authorities planning epidemic containment is underway (Daughton, 2020; Wu et al., 2020) .

            "text": "Nevertheless, the present findings are important to assist stakeholders and WWTP managers anticipate and reduce an imminent risk by developing risk management strategies for health protection of workers. An important tool in this context are the Emergency Response Plans (ERP), which aim to standardize response protocols and J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f inform mitigation actions by sanitation operators when facing emergencies (Rubin et al., 2014; Warren et al., 2009 ). These can be used to minimize the risks and associated impacts arising from events, whether natural or caused by human error. Most water and sanitation operators lack information to support an ERP and would welcome guidance with the planning process. The QMRA developed in this work can be implemented as an early health warning tool in an ERP using the tolerable risk of infection derived by us as a reference to categorize risk level. From this level of risk, mitigation measures can be established that may become more restrictive in terms of workers' exposure as risk levels become higher. Dunn et al. (2014) reported that risk assessment and management have been applied for decades in many industries (including the energy utility sector) and are critical to such operations; however, in the water and sanitation sectors, these practices are relatively new. Emergency preparedness is essential to the resilience of water and wastewater utilities, as they must still provide their vital services to society despite disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic (Sowby, 2020) .",

The use of conservative or worstcase estimates are advisable in QMRA when assumptions are used, such as in the present work, for a safer approach (WHO, 2016). The concentration of viable SARS-CoV-2 in sewage (VC) was calculated using Equation 1. This method assumes a typical stool weight (SW) of 200 g.d -1 (Wu et al., 2020), then multiplies this assumption by the virus concentration in stool of COVID-19 patients (VS) by the AF and by the fraction of the population (FP) served by the WWTP with COVID-19 and having RNA viral in stool during the illness (48% -Cheung et al., 2020). The product is then divided by the flow rate of the WWTP (WF). There are, to the best of our knowledge, seven published studies on the quantification of SARS-CoV-2 load and viral RNA cycle threshold (Ct) values in the faeces of patients testing positive for COVID-19 until August 2020(Cheung et al.,2020;Lescure et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2020; W\u00f6lfel et al.,2020;",

This dose-response model was applied in the present work in the form of an exponential model (Equation 2) and dose was calculated as shown by Equation 3. The risk of infection considered the estimated infectious SARS-CoV-2 in sewage (VC) calculated in Equation 1. It is important to note, however, disadvantages in applying the SARS-CoV-1 model to address dose-response of the novel coronavirus. Although the dose-response parameters for SARS-CoV-1 were defined from pooled datasets that may represent different infection scenarios, much remains unknown about the pathogenesis and transmission mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 as evident from the number of asymptomatic cases and range of presenting symptoms associated with infection in hosts of different ages (Jin et al., 2020; Schr\u00f6der, 2020). Although this introduces uncertainty in this QMRA, the greatest source of both uncertainty and variability in QMRAs come from the exposure assessment component (Haas et al.Probability of infection after a single exposure at the dose d; of viable virus in sewage (PFU.mL -1 ).",

In the considered SJN-WWTP, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in sewage was 9.14x10 2 and 4.44x10 3 GC.mL -1 (VC of 0.91 and 4.44 PFU.mL -1 , respectively), for aggressive and extreme scenarios, respectively. In the S-WWTP, these values increased to 1.08x10 3 and 5.23x10 3 GC.mL -1 (1.08 and 5.23 PFU.mL -1 ), respectively. This variation in values of about 18% among the WWTPs is attributed to the different flow rates of the WWTPs and the different portions of population that contribute to these plants. In the moderate (local) scenario, the total population infected by COVID-19 were at least 22 times lower than in the other conditions, and viral loads were of 4.14x10 1 and 4.87x10 1 GC.mL -1 (0.04 and 0.05 PFU.mL -1 ) in SJN-WWTP and S-WWTP, respectively.Despite the uncertainties of the assumptions defined in the present work, we consider our approach appropriately protective for human health, as the viral loads obtained herein for all evaluated scenarios are in the same order of magnitude of the range reported byFoladori et al. (2020). This article reviewed the scarce studies that have quantified the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage. Further, the authors report that the virus copies in sewage are largely diluted in comparison to those present in the faeces from COVID-19 patients, with a decrease in the concentration by 4-5 orders of magnitude or more. This also corroborates with our study, as we find that virus RNA concentration decreases by approximately 3, 4 and 5 orders of magnitude for extreme, aggressive and moderate scenarios, respectively, considering the viral load in faeces of 3.3x10 7 GC per J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f g of stool (or 3.01x10 7 GC per mL of stool) assumed. Our results -including the lower decrease in the virus load observed in the extreme scenario -are explained by the population contribution to the WWTP, which depends on active cases of COVID-19 (since the whole population does not contribute to the viral load). The higher the infected population, the lower the dilution in sewage networks that serve this population.",

Although SARS-CoV-2 is similarly structured as other coronaviruses and may have similar environmental susceptibility, the possibility of exposure risk among WWTP workers should not be dismissed. Since there have been studies demonstrating exposure among sewage workers to rotavirus, norovirus and adenovirus via virus-laden aerosols (Carducci et al., 2018; Pasalari et al., 2019), the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 as an occupational health hazard should be addressed.
