These conflicts begin with disputes over territorial ownership. They affect local livelihoods, access to and use of space and natural resources, and create power asymmetries. In response to these conflicts, the Federal Conservation Agency has put forward norms that guarantee inclusive arenas for local people to take part in negotiations with park managers. In this study, environmental conflicts caused by the implementation of parks overlapping local population territories are analyzed aiming to understand their role as mechanisms promoting institutional changes. We collected data from two communities that overlap the Serra da Bocaina National Park through interviews, workshops, and direct observations. For each community, we characterized conflicts involving the community and Park officers. We identified consequences to the community's livelihoods and analyzed their influence on institutional change. The results suggest that one community responded to conservation conflicts through actions towards negotiation and collaboration with the national park. The other community promoted changes in agricultural production methods and sought new markets as a strategy for staying in the territory. Conflicts are effective as a mechanism for institutional changes, as local actors articulate with autonomous organizations at different levels. We highlight the importance of a continuous documentation on conflicts and their consequences to rural livelihoods in both communities and conflict management actions taken by the Park in the long term.",

The conflicts concern restrictions on livelihood, access and use of space and natural resources, and power asymmetries in management decisions (Lele et al. 2010; Vedeld et al. 2012; Araujo et al. 2017; Bavinck et al. 2017) . The implementation of parks still raises questions, such as those related to changes on local and public institutions caused by top-down implementation processes over territories inhabited by local people (Jones et al. 2017; Schleicher 2018) . The analysis of environmental conflicts between protected area managers and local populations living within protected areas contribute to understand how such institutional changes take place on the ground (Liu et al. 2010; Ostrom and Basurto 2011; De Pourcq et al. 2017) . For instance, De Pourcq et al. (2017) identified in the literature a variety of causal factors associated with natural resource-related conflicts, including (i) forced displacement, (ii) social exclusion, (iii) deficient community participation processes, (iv) denial of ancestral territorial rights, (v) restrictions on community resource use priorities, (vi) negative impacts of conservation measures on community resources, and (vii) impoverishment resulting from all factors above.",

People living in these communities want to keep their livelihoods inside the SBNP, such as fishing, tourism, and agriculture (Araujo et al. 2017; ).

The community divided into those in favor of removing the restaurants and those against this decision (Conti and Antunes 2012; Bahia et al. 2013) . The decision to remove the restaurants from the Praia do Meio reinforced the conflict between families that owned the restaurants and the park. In some situations, that conflict involves ABAT because this CBO had been successful in establishing an operational base in that beach in accordance with park officers. In 2012, the restaurants were all removed, and the owners were not compensated for, resulting in a conflictive relationship among these individuals, i.e., the park and the families against the removal of restaurants.",

The improvement of organizational and institutional aspects and the strengthening of connections in multilevel networks are important factors in raising awareness of an increasing fairness in decisionmaking processes (Hamilton 2018) .
