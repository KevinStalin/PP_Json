At this point, psychodermatology forms a common field of study based on the relationship and interaction between psychiatry and dermatology. Cosmetology is a special group within dermatology, and the psychosocial needs of this group differ. In this study, it was aimed to examine the moods such as anxiety, fear and depression experienced by the patients during their application to the cosmetology unit during the COVID-19 pandemic process and to compare them with the control group. A total of 162 cases, 80 cases from the cosmetology unit meeting the specified conditions and 82 cases as the control group, were retrospectively evaluated. In all participants, the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) scores decreased significantly compared to the beginning of the pandemic (P = .001). In the study, while depression (HAM-D) and general anxiety (HAM-A) were higher in the cosmetology group compared to the control group (P = .049 and P = .001, respectively), there was no difference in coronavirus anxiety scores (CAS) (P = .24). It should be known that patients who underwent cosmetological procedures during the pandemic period may have anxiety and depression. In this patient group, which requires a special psychodermatological approach, pandemic effects should also be considered. In patients who apply to cosmetology units during the pandemic period, attention should be paid to the relationship between surreal cosmetological process requests and their anxiety and depression state.

It has also triggered a wide variety of psychological problems such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic process, people may experience anxiety, fear and depression as a result of the influence of the media and their observations around them. 4 During the pandemic process, the majority of the society volunteers to stay at home and pay attention to social isolation and precautions, avoiding collective environments.

At the same time, almost all procedures are often time-consuming. 8 The aesthetic dermatology procedures have been classified as mild, moderate and high risky procedures. 9 Dermatologists are currently skeptical about practicing most aesthetic procedures including mild risky ones, for now as they are also at risk. 8 Demographic characteristics of patients who applied to the cosmetology unit in a pre-pandemic study, average age was 33 and approximately 80% was female sex determined. 10 Similar demographic data were found in our study.",

The authors stated that this pandemic causes additional mental psycological problems including anxiety, depression, insomnia, anger, denial, and fear globally. 11 The HAM-D score has been used as an indicator of depression in many studies before, and it has also been used in many dermatoses. 12 In our study, the HAM-D score in the cosmetology group was borderline higher than the control group. These results showed that the cosmetology patient group was more depressed during the COVID-19 pandemic period. ",
