The fight between the surgeon and the pandemic will be a dragging one since the postpandemic efflux of the surgical patients coupled with the 'new normal' practices to prevent COVID 19 spread requires pertinent resources, well-trained personnel, and co-operation among different departments. Emergency surgeries and cancer care have continued all this while, undoubtedly, with unwanted delays and distress. While we continue to prepare ourselves and work in a whole new environment, surgeons are facing the increased chances of litigations and compromised safety. We review what we have come to understand about safe surgical practices during and after the pandemic and the unanswered questions.

Since surgery exposes the healthcare team to blood and body fluids of infected patients, surgical specialties have been struggling all this while trying to strike a balance between the evolving guidelines of sick patient management who need surgical care and protecting themselves and their HCW from undue exposure. The path to this struggle has not always been easy. It has opened up newer hospital management paradigms, surgical care, and postoperative management, including intensive care. It has also made us bend ways to develop newer guidelines without evidence or minimal or insignificant evidence. In learning newer ways of adjusting to the situation, surgeons have come across pitfalls in areas that were not expected or planned but have only made us wiser and sometimes at the cost of exposing the HCW to infection transmission threat. This narrative review aims to highlight important areas of surgical practice that are witnessing unprecedented change and, at the same time, how pitfalls can silently creep up in these altered practices.",

It has been observed that RT-PCR has a high variation in the false-negative rate, which implies that the interpretation of RT-PCR should be made with caution, particularly early in the course of infection. RT-PCR alone should not be the basis to rule out infection if there is high clinical suspicion. We should carefully consider the clinical and epidemiological situations [20] . A particular challenge to HCW safety is our current lack of understanding of the virus's transmissibility duration in either asymptomatic or symptomatic patients [21] . SARS-CoV-2 RNA continues to be detected in upper respiratory tracts of patients recovered from COVID-19 for 12 weeks [22] . According to recent CDC recommendations, isolation can be discontinued ten days following onset of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f symptoms, because the replication-competent virus has not been detected ten days following onset of symptoms [23] . There is evidence that even after respiratory samples are negative for virus in patients who have recovered from a COVID-19 illness, viral RNA remains in the stool for more than 30 days. The clinical significance of fecal RNA is not well understood [24] . Postoperative care such as the liberal use of 2 to 3 antiemetics to control nausea and vomiting more aggressively might help decrease contamination and reduce the risk of spread [2] . Administration of high-flow supplemental oxygen should be avoided because of concerns of aerosol generation. If necessary, low flow supplemental oxygen should be provided through a nasal cannula [2] . Every effort to adhere to enhanced recovery protocols should be made for standardized postoperative care and optimize lengths of hospital stay, efficiency, and complications.",

The interactive communication has some regulations as it involves providing sensitive information and also monetary transactions. Secondly, providing telemedicine services in different centers may be difficult as these may vary on the quality of facility, resources, and workforce. Moreover, the referral services can be complicated as it may not be easy to book referral services in the same hospital or between hospitals. Thirdly, the issues of licensure, facility accreditation, and certification and reimbursement are also uncertain. Lastly, and most importantly, is the issue of privacy and data protection [26] . According to Portnoy et al. [27] , educating HCWs, doctors, and patients about telemedicine's importance during the pandemic, helping people understand how it works, and reducing costs can help remove these barriers. Conventionally, informed consent for surgery focuses on risks and expected benefits, the likely outcome of the proposed procedure, and alternative options. According to a report by The Canadian Medical Protective Association, [28] over a recent 5-year period, 65% of medico-legal cases involving informed consent disputes were of surgical procedures, and only 21% of these cases have been decided in favor of the surgeon. Therefore, it is essential to know whether patients are aware of this impact and proceed or postpone their surgery during this pandemic. In the current crisis, postponement may initiate some queries related to morbidity, the medico-legal impact of which is unknown.",

Do we need to tell the patient of such a probability during admission? There is an increasing perception among health authorities that the risk of infection with COVID 19-should be a part of informed consent for surgery [29] . Ferguson et al. recommend to include five additional points while discussing \"enhanced informed consent\" with the patients. Firstly, there is a lack of information on the risks of routine procedures during the pandemic. Secondly, there is an increased risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 from the hospital. A significant third point is the changed day-to-day hospital operations, which may alter the patient's perioperative experience. Due to visitor restriction policies, the patients might not be able to communicate with their family members, or there might be a possibility that postoperative care might be delivered in general nursing units with staff that is not well trained to look after postoperative patients. Another significant issue that should be discussed is a possible altered outcome resulting from a shortage of resources due to the pandemic. Lastly, the surgeons should respect the patient's wishes and dignity amidst considerable uncertainties that the pandemic has introduced in an evolving publichealth crisis [29] .",

It calls for regular staff rotation, testing, and designating COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 areas in the hospital, which are necessary measures to limit spread. Doubling or cross-covering of duty rotas anticipating staff absence due to sickness or quarantine, reducing doctor-topatient ratios in some parts of the hospital, and strengthening surgical teams by recruiting retired surgeons, clinical academics, or final-year medical students are some of the possible approaches to meet the crisis. However, this model works only until the community transmission reaches a critical threshold when the hospital designation does not matter [32] . Nevertheless, we do not have sufficient data to suggest that HCWs are a source of infection and have led to the hospital or even community spread. The lockdown was imposed in many countries worldwide, exempting the health care industry, and no guidelines were developed on how to protect HCWs who are at increased risk of infection.",

Most of the current guidelines are based more on observation or experience than on a high level of evidence.

Although care of cancer patients has been prioritized, these patients theoretically have a higher chance of getting infected.

In the presence of delay in surgery due to COVID-19 or other reasons beyond 30 days, preoperative workup and reassessment of comorbidities should be done[41]. Teleconsultations should be used for guiding patients forthe same to prevent hospital visits and exposure to COVID-19. There should be a composite assessment and sound clinical judgment to decide clinical appropriateness and surgical prioritization. The consent form needs to be revised for COVID-19, and informed consent should be taken regarding hospital acquisition of COVID-19. Office, clinic, waiting room should have six feet distancing of chairs. Older patients, frail, and COVID-19 positive should be reviewed on a priority basis. Evaluation and discussion should be done for patients' need for rehabilitation medicine and skilled nursing facility before surgery. The preoperative clinic should consider screening all patients before the appointment for COVID-19 disease, including temperature checks and routine screening of all staff and others working in the facility.

Accordingly, manyhospitals have divided medical facilities into a dedicated COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 zones and a testing protocol for all admitted patients. However, two situations need attention. In one, the patient treated as non-COVID-19 may have an attendant who turns out to be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f COVID-19 positive. As the patient and attendant both remain in the non-COVID 19 zone, where HCWs are likely to be working without full PPE, this attendant is potentially at risk of spreading the infection to other patients (in a large facility) and HCWs. Even if the hospital reserves the policy for testing all attendants, situations where different attendants visit the patient during hospital stay (typical in a large healthcare facility), may still threaten infection transmission. Similar episodes were experienced by the authors in two instances in their hospital (unpublished data), resulting in the quarantine of many HCWs and other patients in the ward who all had been primary contacts straining the already compromised workforce.The second possibility is a non-COVID-19 patient who turns out to be positive during his/her hospital stay. If the patient remains asymptomatic, it is challenging to judge when and how the patient becomes positive. Mandatory testing of all attendants visiting the patient in the hospital and all inpatients regularly is a daunting task. Moreover, local resources and workforce reserves should also be considered in this context.",
