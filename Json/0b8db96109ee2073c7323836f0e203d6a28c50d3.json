Different drug intervention acting at multiple stages of pathogenesis of COVID-19 can substantially reduce the infection induced,thereby decreasing the mortality. Also population level control strategies can reduce the spread of the COVID-19 substantially. Motivated by these observations, in this work we propose and study a multi scale model linking both within-host and between-host dynamics of COVID-19. Initially the natural history dealing with the disease dynamics is studied. Later, comparative effectiveness is performed to understand the efficacy of both the within-host and population level interventions. Findings of this study suggest that a combined strategy involving treatment with drugs such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir that inhibits viral replication and immunotherapies like monoclonal antibodies, along with environmental hygiene and generalized social distancing proved to be the best and optimal in reducing the basic reproduction number and environmental spread of the virus at the population level.",

The results suggest that a combined strategy involving treatment with drugs such as Arbidol, remdesivir, Lopinavir/Ritonavir that inhibits viral replication and immunotherapies like monoclonal antibodies, along with environmental hygiene and generalized social distancing proved to be the best and optimal in reducing the basic reproduction number and environmental virus at the population level. With a lot of research happening in the field of multi-drug therapy, our results offer some basic insights of their efficiency and effectiveness at population scale. These results can be helpful in public health measures and policies. With more availability of data of within-host dynamics in COVID-19 patients, a better refined and comprehensive models can be framed based on this model that can more closer to real life situations. The multi scale modeling studies done here is the first of its kind for COVID-19.",
