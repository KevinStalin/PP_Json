Interestingly, this study did not find significant differences in serum IL-33 between healthy controls and COVID-19 patients. However, a significant association for IL-33 levels at admission with adverse outcome (ICU admission, requiring ventilation or death) has been reported, with a very good predictive value (AUROC 0.83) in patients <70 years 18 .

Moreover, sST2 showed a decline in patients at discharge, displaying a fully dynamic behavior that is not present with other biomarkers. Interestingly, discharge sST2 correlated negatively with hospital stay length. This is suggestive that decline in sST2 is delayed with regard to clinical improvement. Other reports have shown persistently elevated sST2 levels in severe COVID-19 cases as long as 30 days after clinical onset 17, 19 . It remains to be elucidated whether sST2 will recover completely to normal values and whether persistent sST2 levels would associate to clinical sequalae in COVID-19 patients.",

Accumulating evidence supports sST2 levels elevate early in SARS-CoV2 infection and that such changes represent an independent risk factor for worse outcome, outpowering other biomarkers that so far have been guiding clinical and therapeutical handling. Another consistent report is the persistence of elevated sST2 after apparent clinical resolution. Given the well-established associations of sST2 levels with other lung and cardiovascular diseases, it is mandatory to investigate whether such sST2 levels reflect some inflammatory memory with long-term consequences. Our findings also lend support to the hypothesis of an IL-33/ST2 axis led pathophysiology in COVID-19. Pharmacological modulators for this axis are available and currently being trialed for other pathologies, that could be evaluated for treating or preventing severe cases of COVID-19.",

IL-33 effects would be auto-amplified by IL-33 induction of IL-33 release and ST2 expression and sST2 release, as observed recently for asthma 21 . IL-33 is a well-known factor in asthma, one of the several lung diseases where IL-33 plays a relevant role 21 . More importantly, IL-33 has also been shown to participate in lung epithelium response to viral infection 22 and to decrease antiviral innate immunity in this organ 23 . Due to technical difficulties in measuring IL-33 levels, circulating sST2 has been often employed as a surrogate marker of IL-33/ST2 axis status. Several studies have shown serum sST2 concentrations are elevated, and correlate with prognosis, in patients with pulmonary disorders including asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, severe sepsis, and trauma 13 .

Sato et al. investigated the usefulness of sST2 as a surrogate inflammatory biomarker in Kawasaki disease 25 . They tested sST2 along with other classic biomarkers and showed that troponin and natriuretic peptide were not useful, while sST2 showed high concentrations in patients with Kawasaki disease which, in addition, correlated with clinical worse course 25,,26 . Of note, a rare, but severe pediatric manifestation in COVID-19 has been described which closely resembles Kawasaki disease 27 . sST2 is also an established prognosis maker in heart failure (HF). sST2 blood concentrations correlate with mortality, alone or in combination with other classical biomarkers such as natriuretic peptides 28 Interestingly, the study by Pascual-Figal et al. provided strong evidence that vascular and pulmonary endothelium, as well as pneumocytes are main sources of ST2 in ADHF 10,9 . The potential association of elevated sST2 levels in COVID-19 with myocarditis signs and markers observed in these patients deserves further consideration, as does the possible consequences for the cardiovascular system of a potentially sustained elevation in sST2 in convalescent patients, identified in this and other studies.",
