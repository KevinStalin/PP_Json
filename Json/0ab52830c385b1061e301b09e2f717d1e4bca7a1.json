Here, we report generation of double-gene-knockout (DKO) pigs harboring edited knockout alleles for known receptor proteins CD163 and pAPN and show that DKO pigs are completely resistant to genotype 2 PRRSV and TGEV. We found no differences in meat-production or reproductive-performance traits between wild-type and DKO pigs, but detected increased iron in DKO muscle. Additional infection challenge experiments showed that DKO pigs exhibited decreased susceptibility to porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), thus offering unprecedented in vivo evidence of pAPN as one of PDCoV receptors. Beyond showing that multiple gene edits can be combined in a livestock animal to achieve simultaneous resistance to two major viruses, our study introduces a valuable model for investigating infection mechanisms of porcine pathogenic viruses that exploit pAPN or CD163 for entry.",

Since its discovery in the United States in 1987, PRRS has rapidly spread worldwide, with frequent outbreaks causing large economic losses (Holtkamp et al., 2013) . Three surface receptors on porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) have been shown to function in PRRSV invasion in vivo: heparin sulphate (HS), sialoadhesin (Sn), and CD163 (Calvert et al., 2007; Crocker and Gordon, 1986; Jusa et al., 1997) . Multiple studies have reported that CD163 is an essential receptor for PRRSV infection, with scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 (SRCR5) serving as the core domain for virus recognition (Calvert et al., 2007; Van Gorp et al., 2010; Patton et al., 2009) .",

The technology makes possible for precise modification of more than one gene simultaneously, which is particularly desirable for obtaining important economic traits that are controlled by multiple genes. In 2016, Prather's group was the first to use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate SRCR5 domain-targeted CD163 knockout pigs. They demonstrated that a CD163 knockout line was completely resistant to genotype 2 PRRSV infection (Whitworth et al., 2016) . Subsequently, several laboratories have generated anti-PRRSV pigs targeting CD163. For example, the CD163 SRCR5 domain was replaced with human CD163-Like SRCR8 domain to generate PRRSV genotype 1 resistance (Wells et al., 2017) . Wei et al., 2018 reported homozygous geneedited Large White pigs with a 50 bp deletion in exon 7 of the CD163 gene (Wei et al., 2018) that are fully resistant to genotype 2 PRRSV. There are also examples of deletion of the SRCR5 domain seeking resistance to both PRRSV genotypes (Burkard et al., 2017) , or introducing a premature termination in the CD163 SRCR5 domain to generate HP-PRRSV (highly pathogenic PRRSV)-resistant Duroc pigs . Deleting the SRCR5 LBP region has also been reported to generate a PRRSV genotype 2 resistant pigs . All these studies demonstrate that PRRSVresistant pig breeds can be generated by editing the CD163 gene, enabling alleviation of the severity of PRRSV.",

TGEV is globally distributed and causes tremendous economic losses in pork production (Gerdts and Zakhartchouk, 2017) . Characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea, and dehydration, the mortality rate of TGEV-infected piglets under the age of 14 days approaches 100%. TGEV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA coronavirus which targets pig intestinal epithelium for infection (Brierley et al., 1989; Wesley and Lager, 2003) . Studies have shown that the pAPN protein acts as a receptor in mediating TGEV infection. The viral glycoproteins bind to pAPN receptors on the surface of small intestinal epithelial cells and mediate membrane fusion, thus resulting in the virus entering into eLife digest Pig epidemics are the biggest threat to the pork industry. In 2019 alone, hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide were lost due to various pig diseases, many of them caused by viruses. The porcine reproductive and respiratory virus (PRRS virus for short), for instance, leads to reproductive disorders such as stillbirths and premature labor. Two coronaviruses -the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (or TGEV) and the porcine delta coronavirus -cause deadly diarrhea and could potentially cross over into humans. Unfortunately, there are still no safe and effective methods to prevent or control these pig illnesses, but growing disease-resistant pigs could reduce both financial and animal losses.",

The low level of PRRSV RNA that was initially detectable in the DKO line at 12 hpi is likely attributable to the adsorbed PRRSV independent of the existence of CD163, as CD163 is thought to be primarily responsible for the uncoating and viral RNA release processes of PRRSV infection Van Gorp et al., 2008) .",

The body weight of the DKO pigs increased, throughout the 14 day post viral challenge observation period: the detected body weights of the WT pigs were all lower than DKO pigs after 0 dpi ( Figure 2E ). Of the six challenged WT pigs, one was slaughtered at 10 dpi to harvest PAMs, and the five remaining WT pigs died within 11 dpi. In sharp contrast, all four pigs in the DKO group remained healthy, and survived for the entire duration of the 14-day experiment ( Figure 2F ). Among the dead and slaughtered WT pigs, the lungs were swollen, with severe bleeding, and obvious lesions, while the lung tissues of dissected DKO pigs did not exhibit lesions or any other distinct symptoms associated with PRRSV ( Figure 2G ). Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining showed thickening of the alveolar walls and infiltration of a large number of inflammatory Examination of PRRSV antigens in lung tissue via IHC, it was revealed that the viral antigens were present in the lungs of the WT group, but not that of the DKO pigs ( Figure 2H , lower panel). Moreover, we measured the PRRSV viral load in the serum of both groups at 0, 3, 7, 10, and 14 dpi and found that in the WT group, the PRRSV load increased rapidly and significantly by 7 dpi, reaching its maximum at 7 dpi. In agreement with other experiments showing viral resistance, the PRRSV viremia in the DKO group remained negative throughout the challenge ( Figure 2I ). We also tested the PRRSV viral load in PAMs, lung tissues, and tonsil tissues of the two groups of pigs after viral challenge. Whereas a high titer of PRRSV was detected in all tissues examined in the WT group, PRRSV was almost undetectable in DKO pigs ( Figure 2J ). From 3 dpi, the amount of PRRSV-specific ELISA antibodies in the serum of WT pigs increased significantly, and antibody levels were positive (S/ P!0.4) at 7 and 10 dpi, while such antibodies in DKO pigs remained consistently negative (S/P<0.4) ( Figure 2K ).

Whether pAPN functions as a receptor or co-receptor in PDCoV infection of pigs remains controversial. To test the hypothesis that pAPN may functionally mediate PDCoV infection, we tested the susceptibility of our DKO pigs to this virus. Two 45-day-old DKO pigs and four WT pigs of the same age and breed were challenged with PDCoV. A total of 16 mL of PDCoV (2.5 \u00c2 10 8 TCID 50 /mL) was orally administered to each pig in two doses (Day 0 and Day 1, 8 mL/day). During the 14 days of PDCoV challenge study, both the DKO and WT pigs appeared normal, with no distinct differences in body temperature or weight (data not shown). Blood was collected at 0, 7, and 14 dpi to assay for levels of virus-specific antibodies. At 7 and 14 dpi, WT pigs were all antibody-positive, while the DKO pigs were all antibody-negative at 7 dpi, but carried antibody levels comparable to that of the WT group by 14 dpi ( Figure 4A ). This suggests that the double-gene knockout led to a delayed onset of humoral immunity in pigs, possibly due to delayed-immune system exposure to the virus. All pigs were slaughtered at 14 dpi, and the small intestine tissues were collected to evaluate disease severity. It was found that the intestinal wall of the WT had become thinner, with watery fluid in the small intestine, and mesenteric hyperemia, none of which was observed in the small intestine of the DKO pigs ( Figure 4B ).",

In the ileum, there were signs of necrosis and shedding of intestinal mucosal intraepithelial cells and naked lamina propria. The extent of lesions in the WT pigs was more severe than that of the DKO pigs ( Figure 4C ). We also detected the ratio of intestinal villus height to the crypt depth, and found that compared with the mock group, the three intestinal segments of both of the WT group and the DKO group had intestinal villous atrophy, but the degree of villous atrophy in the ileal tissue in the DKO group was lower than that of the WT group ( Figure 4D) . In addition, we tested the resistance of PAMs derived from DKO pigs to PDCoV. DKO and WT PAMs were infected with PDCoV, and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA), tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 ) assays, qRT-PCR, and western blot analyses to assess PDCoV proliferation in PAMs all indicated that DKO PAMs exhibit significantly decreased susceptibility of PDCoV infection compared to WT PAMs (Figure 4-figure supplement 1) . These data suggest that although the DKO line is still susceptible to PDCoV infection, the viral invasion and damage to the small intestines was partially inhibited compared to that of the WT line.

            "text": "Conventional breeding for complex traits using molecular marker-assisted selection is a lengthy process, requiring multiple rounds of crosses and backcrosses to introgress each individual gene. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing not only allows bypassing of this long process, but also provides a possible means to obtain multiple beneficial genotypes in a single generation while also avoiding gene penetration from donor species, thus maintaining the desirable qualities of the original species. Zhou et al., 2015 first used CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with SCNT to generate knockout of PARK2 and PINK1 genes, whose dysfunction are known to contribute to the early onset of Parkinson's disease in humans . Huang et al., 2017 got the pig model with metabolic disorder successfully by editing apolipoprotein E and low density lipoprotein receptor genes simultaneously . Our study is the first report on how multiple gene edits can be combined in livestock animal to offer simultaneous resistance to two major viral infection. Similar to the previous reports above, double knockout efficiency using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated dual gene editing method without any drug or flow cytometry screening was high in our study, reaching 6.30% (17 DKO cell colonies out of 270 cell colonies). In this experiment, we quickly generated a large number of DKO pigs by re-cloning. We found that the re-cloning efficiency (0.9%, 20/2270) was much higher than the primary cloning efficiency (0.2%, 8/3780). A possible reason for this elevated efficiency could be that the monoclonal cells used for the primary cloning must be cultured in vitro for a long time, which has been reported to inhibit cloning efficiency (Li et al., 2003; Magnani et al., 2008; Mastromonaco et al., 2006) . The donor cells used in re-cloning were ear-derived fibroblasts isolated directly from DKO pigs, eliminating the requirement for a long-term, in vitro screening process. Our findings support the notion that the efficiency of this approach is not gene specific, and may be applicable to the knockout of other genes that allow improving disease resistance or animal production. In 2007, Calvert et al. first discovered that CD163 functions as a PRRSV receptor protein during PAMs infection, which has since been confirmed by several studies (Calvert et al., 2007; Van Gorp et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2014; Patton et al., 2009) . Structural studies of CD163 revealed that the SRCR5 domain corresponding to CD163 exon seven is necessary to mediate PRRSV infection (Van Gorp et al., 2010) . In recent years, several groups have successfully generated PRRSV-resistant gene-edited pigs by targeting exon 7 of the pig CD163 gene (Burkard et al., 2017; The online version of this article includes the following source data for The online version of this article includes the following source data for Table 3 : Source data 1.

In the present study, we used a single sgRNA targeting exon 7 of CD163, generated an 8 bp double-stranded deletion that terminated protein translation near the target site. Our finding on the complete resistance to PRRSV genotype 2 in our knockout line is consistent with those previous reports. CD163 is known to play a role in promoting the clearance of plasma free haemoglobin (Kristiansen et al., 2001) . Our finding that the DKO pigs have higher meat Fe content and have elevated serum Hp levels is consistent with this idea, and may explain the observed darker red color in our DKO meat. Interestingly, and consistent to our finding, Wells et al., 2017 also reported that the serum Hp levels are elevated in CD163 knockout pigs (Wells et al., 2017) . Despite the slight color score increase, no abnormal growth or reproductive performance was observed in our DKO pigs, and the meat color of both DKO pigs and WT pigs were within the normal range. Production performance evaluations and identification of pork nutritional components showed that our DKO pigs were indistinguishable from that of the WT pigs in growth rate and reproductive performances, except for the meat color score and iron content. However, the number of DKO pigs tested by us is still small, and the production performance of DKO pigs still needs to be verified in large populations in the future.",

Our data showing that pAPN knockout can completely prevent TGEV virus infection are consistent with these recently published findings. In addition to TGEV and PRRSV, we also determined if pAPN deletion conferred protection against PDCoV. APN is a receptor for multiple coronaviruses and is abundantly expressed on small intestinal epithelial cells, which has led to the speculation that pAPN may also be a receptor for PDCoV. Wang et al., 2018 and Li et al., 2018 proposed that pAPN functions as a receptor in mediating PDCoV infection Wang et al., 2018) . However, another study found that knockout of pAPN in IPI-2I cells inhibited but did not completely block PDCoV infection, suggesting that pAPN was not essential for viral recognition (Zhu et al., 2018) . Taken together, these studies suggest that pAPN may be involved in PDCoV infection, but PDCoV may also be able to enter cell through other pathway(s).",

            "text": "Our results on the delayed PDCoV-specific neutralizing antibodies production, and a reduced extent of gross and histopathological lesions on small intestine in DKO pigs compared to WT pigs are consistent with this previous suggestion that pAPN may play a role but is not the only path for PDCoV cell entry. Interestingly, a recent study showed that PAMs, but not lung fibroblast-like cells, from pAPN knockout pigs showed resistance to PDCoV infection (Stoian et al., 2020) , a finding consistent with our in vitro experiments showing that DKO PAMs exhibit decreased susceptibility to PDCoV infection. In addition, pAPN knockout pigs are susceptible to PDCoV when virus levels were detected using qRT-PCR, and virus neutralization activity was measured, although the extent of tissue lesions between the KO and WT groups was not compared (Stoian et al., 2020) . Our findings are in line with this study reporting that pAPN knockout pigs are still susceptible to PDCoV. However, as reflected by the delay in neutralizing antibody response, and much lighter intestine damage in the DKO pigs, the susceptibility of the pAPN knockout group to the virus is reduced compared that of the WT pigs, indicating the potential role of pAPN in mediating PDCoV infection. Additionally, the effect of CD163 knockout in the delayed adaptive immune response cannot be ignored. Despite the important role of CD163 in innate immunity, an inhibiting effect of soluble CD163 on the adaptive immune system has also been reported (Frings et al., 2002; O'Connell et al., 2017) . It is thus possible that the delayed adaptive immune response we observed in PDCoV-infected DKO pigs may be associated with CD163 knockout-induced immunosuppression.",

When the cells grew to 80% confluence, approximately 10 6 cells were transfected with pX330-CD163 (2.5 ug) and pX330-pAPN (2.5 ug) plasmids. A Lonza 2B nuclear transfection system was used for transfection with Nucleofector program T-016. The entire transfection process was performed according to the kit instructions (Lonza, VPI-1002). Cells were cultured for 48 hr after transfection and then seeded into 10 cm dishes at a density of 150 cells/dish. The culture medium was changed every 3 days, and cells were cultured for 10 days to form singlecell colonies. Single-cell colonies were transferred to 48-well plates for expansion culture. When cells in the 48-well plates reached confluence, 1/3 of the cells were taken for genotype identification, and the remaining cells continued to expand. Cells with genotypes identified as double-gene mutations were cultured and frozen for SCNT.",
