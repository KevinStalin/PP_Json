A recent study had pointed out a specific state of inflammation, unique for its characteristics and distinct from the classic inflammatory state, which manifests itself in the presence of a high-calorie diet and \"susceptible\" lifestyles [3] . The term metaflammation well describes this kind of inflammation caused by a high caloric and sugar-rich diet which mainly originates in the visceral adipose tissue [4] . This inflammatory-eliciting insult triggers a cellular response consisting of the release of several intracellular signals and a low levels of cytokines such as Tumour Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) [5] . Moreover, experiments have shown a correlation of these triggers with the inhibition of the insulin signal by phosphorylation of a serine in the Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 (IRS-1) [6] . The result is a malfunctioning receptor unable to bind insulin, turning the cells as insulin-resistant. Summarising, the prolonged condition of a pro-inflammatory response alters the metabolic functions of the adipocytes [7] and, in the long term, causes hyperglycemia and eventually full-blown type 2 diabetes [8] .",

Because of this limitation, we constructed an approximation, namely a surrogate model being able to forecast the output of the model M-T2D with a reduced computational effort. The need for reducing the computational burden of a simulation tool occurs in many research fields. For instance, [10] proposed a statistical model for computer output being interested in the assessment of the computer code and the identification of the most significant predictors to efficiently design experiments. The authors in [11] investigated the same issues considering a Bayesian approach based on Gaussian processes. The study in [12] proposed a spatio-temporal neural network as a surrogate model for a particular type of chemical process, namely the polymerization reactor. The Gaussian process has been applied in [13] to approximate spatio-temporal processes while [14] used a Gaussian process with a modified before approximate dynamic processes in hydrology. For an up to date review regarding approximated models and techniques for complex processes, the interested reader can refer to [15] .",

Examples of this kind of studies include the diagnosis of asymptomatic liver disease [16] , the prediction of opioid dependence [17] , the evaluation of sociodemographic determinants of health status in aging [18] , the prediction of the mobility of medical rescue-vehicles [19] , forecasting adverse perioperative outcomes [20] , the measure of caloric intake at the population level [21] , the personalisation of oncological treatment in radiogenomics [22] , the determination of features of systolic blood pressure variability [23] , the identification of clinical variables in bipolar disorder [24] and, interestingly, a specific interest in uncovering potential predictors of diabetes (type 1 and 2) using large set of data [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . ML can also support global efforts in various fields of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases, developing up-to-date text and data-mining techniques to assist COVID-19-related research, especially by developing drugs faster (screening and detecting antibody virus interactions and detect viral antigens), understanding viruses better, mapping where viruses come from, and hopefully predicting the next pandemic [33, 34] . ML may offer accurate results with fewer requirements if compared with traditional mathematical modeling and it is often used to extract harderto-detect knowledge from unstructured data. ML models are particularly useful in settings where the input is represented by the enormous amount of diagnostic data whereas the output consists in predictive therapeutic options. At variance with the classical application of ML methods, in the present work which deals with the prediction of the risk of T2D, we use Random Forest to \"approximate\" M-T2D. For this purpose, the training set consisted of a large number of virtual (i.e. simulated) subjects experiencing different lifestyle conditions. The ML-derived surrogate model can recapitulate the simulated outcomes, thus computing the risk index with a significantly smaller computational effort, therefore allowing, as anticipated, to be computed in real-time on mobile devices.",

It incorporates the hormonal model inspired by [40] in which both glucagon and insulin are represented and glucose regulation is achieved by altering the balance between the two. Concerning the original model in [39] and with the aim of achieving greater generalization and user-customization, M-T2D provides an enhanced description of the physical exercise similar to that in [41] and [42] . In particular, we used a \"relative\" (rather than fixed) exercise intensity as well as the estimation of functional capacity in relation to age, sex, anthropometric characteristics, and current fitness status [37] . Moreover, M-T2D includes oxygen consumption and the dynamics of epinephrine as directly dependent on the relative exercise intensity to modulate hormones and metabolites responses to different exercise modalities (e.g. cycling, walking, running, stepping). For what concerns the description of the physiological changes due to food ingestion, stomach emptying, and absorption of macronutrients monomers in the gut [38] we follow the work in [43] and [44] . The description of the dynamics of alanine and triglycerides from proteins and fats ingestion, respectively, needed the settings of proper parameters, since the model in [43] is limited to the description of glucose dynamics. Insulin resistance or insulin-deficient states leads to a reduced response of tissues, such as the skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue, to insulin, therefore M-T2D also implements the effects of insulin resistance on the glucose uptake by peripheral organs [45] . Besides that, in modeling fasting plasma glucose concentration we took into consideration factors depending on dietary habits, physical activity, and inflammation. These factors contribute in different ways to increase or diminish the blood sugar level. The glycemia (i.e. presence of glucose in the blood) rises due to unhealthy eating habits, leading to inflammation. Also, it decreases if the patient does physical exercises.",

In details, TDEE is the result of the sum of Resting Energy Expenditure (REE), Activity Energy Expenditure (AEE) [57] and Thermic Effect of Food (TEF) [58] . We implemented the equations by Mifflin and coworkers in [46] to estimate the REE considering weight, height, age, and sex. We determine the AEE based on the intensity, duration, volume of oxygen consumed, and the number of sessions of the exercise as in [45] . Finally, the TEF is the amount of energy expenditure that occurs after eating, due to the cost of digesting and processing food and represents about 10% of the calories due to meal ingestion [58] . The resulting TDEE represents the number of calories that have to be ingested to have a balance among energy intake and expenditure. In our calculation, these calories are somehow arbitrarily yet realistically split between breakfast (25%TDEE), lunch (45%TDEE) and dinner (30%TDEE). Furthermore, for each meal, we (1) m = |S| \u00b7 |A| \u00b7 |W | \u00b7 |H | \u00b7 (1 + N PA \u00b7 |D PA | \u00b7 |I PA |) \u00b7 |C ME | \u00b7 |P ME | \u00b7 |F ME |.

Finally, to convert calories to grams we used the Atwater general factor system [59] . These \"standards\" or average values of grams for carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are used as reference values (median or 'med' value). Simple multiplications to the constants 0.8 and 1.5 are used to fix 'low' and 'high' quantities of the food intake description given above. The complete patient specification of the initial condition of the simulation is thus given as a string vector. For instance, the initial condition specified by the string female 28 obese tall 2 60/40 low/high/ low corresponds to a 28 years old female subject, tall and obese, who exercises twice a week (sixty minutes each time with an intensity of 40%VO 2 max ) and who follows a diet consisting in a low amount of carbohydrates and fats but rich in proteins.

The execution of M-T2D starting from the initial condition x generated a complete trajectory of these variables with a time resolution of ten seconds. However, since we are interested in analysing the condition of the virtual subject only at the end of a specified period of 6 months, these measures are taken after 6 months of routinely and uninterrupted physical activity and diet patterns as specified (among the other things) in x . Formally, where t is 6 months. The set {(x (k) , y (k) ) : k = 1, . . . , m} is used as a training set for the development of a statistical model able to recapitulate, given x , the dynamics of the computational model and to predict the risk of developing T2D over a time horizon of 6 months. In other words, our goal was to find a statistical/ML model (which should not be confused with the computational model M-T2D) able to predict the dependent variables, namely y given a set of regressors/predictors x , that is, the initial conditions defining the virtual subject and her/his lifestyle. The new statistical model is, therefore, a surrogate model of M-T2D whose role is only to forecast the T2D risk after 6 months for given initial conditions that were not considered for the construction of the synthetic data. The main reason for finding such ML model is that the complexity of M-T2D requires a significant computational effort to run, whereas a statistical model, once trained, provides a real time solution of computing y (i) given x (i) allowing a fast generalisation to cases other than those in the training set x (k) , y (k) k=1,...,m .",

Moreover, the variables related to the diet ( C ME , P ME , F ME , cfr. correlation plot in the middleboxes next to diagonal) do appear strongly correlated.

The linear regression model obtained by defining \u03c8 in Eq. (4) as a linear combination of the regressors, was not able to describe the behavior of none of the dependent variables. Indeed, all scatter plots in Fig. 3a are far from the y = x line. Interestingly, the scatter plots of BMI (leftmost panel) and of the TNF (rightmost panel) suggests that the linear model does partially capture these variables' dynamics, indeed despite an unwanted very large variability in the predicted value, a positive correlation between predicted and true values is observed. Conversely, results shown in the middle panel in Fig. 3a pertaining the GBL suggest that the linear regression model fails in this case because there is no evident correlation between the true and the fitted values. The result confirms that there is a non-linear structure among x and y and hints to the use of non-linear models. Figure 3b -d are related to the polynomial regression models of degree d = 2 , 3 and 4 respectively, obtained by defining \u03c8 in Eq. (4) as a polynomial of order d. From the plots, it is clear that BMI (leftmost panel) and TNF (rightmost panel) are only partially described by these models because the scatter plots show large variation in the predicted value hence the use of polynomial models does not improve significantly when increasing d. Likewise the linear model, the middle panels in Fig. 3b -d of true versus predicted GBL fails to show a clear correlation hence leading to the conclusion that the polynomial structure is also not appropriate.",

As first results, we looked at the variables' importance using a method already described in [62] . In a few words, we measured the impact of each variable on the predictive power of the model, as the difference between the prediction error computed when some noise is added to the predictors and the prediction error computed on the original predictors. Such impact is shown in Fig. 4 , where the variables' importance for each of the elements of y are plotted. The impact of some variables appears to be the same for the three variables BMI, GBL, and TNF. Indeed, we observed that the variables related to the physical activity (i.e. N PA , D PA , and I PA ) appear as the less important. This fact points out that better accounting for the physical activity on anti-inflammatory factors as well as on the reduction of glucose baseline already on time horizons smaller than 6 months is required in M-T2D. This is a task that is already ongoing and will be reported in due time [45] . The most important variable for both the BMI (grey bar in Fig. 4 ) and the GBL (black bar) is the initial value of the body mass index ( BMI 0 ). This means that weight plays an important role in determining the glucose baseline thus in the determination of the risk of T2D. As for the remaining variables, we observed that they have a comparable impact on the BMI. This is not the same for the glucose baseline or GBL index, for which the second most important dependence is with the number of carbohydrates in the diet ( C ME ). For what concerns the inflammation represented by the level of TNF-\u03b1 (i.e. TNF index, white bar in Fig. 4 ) the most important dependence is, as expected, the age (A) followed in order of importance by C ME and BMI 0 . This is interesting as it goes along the recently defined concept of Inflammaging [63] which joins immune-metabolic processes with age-related diseases in a single, integrated, clinical framework.",

This method is based on the idea that variables that split close to the root play an important role in prediction error, while variables that split next to the leaves do not influence that much the prediction error. To have quantitative method for the idea just explained we need to introduce two concepts [62] : the maximal \u03bd-subtrees and the Fig. 5 Top twelve pairwise co-influence on y calculated by method in [62] minimal depth. Given a tree T , a \u03bd-subtrees T \u03bd is a subtree of T whose root is split using \u03bd ; a maximal \u03bd-subtrees is a \u03bd-subtrees that is not a subtree of a larger \u03bd-subtrees. The minimal depth D \u03bd is the distance from the root of T to the root of the closest maximal \u03bd -subtrees, that is D \u03bd measures the distance from the root of the first split on \u03bd . The idea explained above can be expressed in terms of the minimal depth as follows: the smaller D \u03bd the higher the impact of \u03bd on the prediction error.",

Small value on the diagonal element (i, i) together with small value on the off diagonal element i, j is a sign of significant co-influence on y between variables x i and x j . This method provides similar results to the one based on the pairwise importance, indeed smaller values of both diagonal and off-diagonal elements correspond to initial BMI 0 , C ME , A, P ME , F ME and S while the variables related to the physical activity shows higher values.",

A tool which allows self-assessment based on lifestyle parameters, however approximate, remains a very valuable and beneficial means to increase awareness of the risk of T2D. Nowadays, tools of this kind are within technological reach thanks to the wide-spread use of monitoring devices able to keep track of exercise and dietary patterns and, at the same time, the coming into view of computational methods which estimate the risk of progressing from the healthy (i.e. pre-diabetic) to the disease condition. The present study shows that it is possible to positively exploit these technologies. Smartphones, tablets, wristwatches and wearable devices are, and increasingly will be, used in everyday life as tools with the potential to foster a proper and healthy life, creating a positive impact on users with an improved effect on the quality of life. Today, the ability to estimate an individual patient's trajectory risk in real-time remains poor. Knowledge of a patient's dynamic risk profile may allow physicians to modify targeted and step by step changes in the T2D care plan that will alter the patient's outcome trajectory [20] . At present, computational tools which exploit the availability of massive data collected by personal assistant devices employing ML techniques are the focus of a great deal of research efforts. Considering recent improvements in healthcare delivery technologies like smartphone applications, device connectivity, artificial intelligence and machine-learning technology there is strong opportunity to reach better efficiency in pre-diabetes and diabetes care, and ameliorate patient involvement in diabetes self-management, which can decrease the surge of diabetes-related healthcare expenditures, paving the way to the future scenario of patient-driven diabetes care in the technology era [66] . Also, this new approach has great potential as a lowcost monitoring tool for nutritional habits and physical activity of different segments of the population, permitting their users to achieve knowledge hardly comprehensible by even the best expert.",

Here we focused on the prediction of the final state of the simulator has given some initial conditions, therefore in the current implementation the ML model provides a 6 months ahead risk of T2D to the users; this time horizon will be extended to predict the whole dynamic of the simulator. This extension, that will be presented in due time [45] , will provide the complete dynamic of the variables related to T2D risk, thus becoming a powerful instrument for users as a short-and mid-term assessment tool. In perspective, the ability to link the subject's parameters with measuring devices such as those in portable communication systems (smartphones and wristwatches) enables the development of health care systems linked in real-time to issue alerts, warnings or simple recommendations to the patient [35] . In the near future, the \"realtime\" execution of the model, with completely customizable input parameters can be envisaged as a dedicated bioinformatics service, able to provide increasingly personalized healthcare and facilitating self-monitoring.",
