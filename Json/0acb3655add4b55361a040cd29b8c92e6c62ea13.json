It was shown that this class of synthetic antibiotics could possess antiviral activity as a broad range of anti-infective activities. Based on these findings, we have undertaken in silico molecular docking study to demonstrate, for the first time, the principle for the potential evidence pointing ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin ability to interact with COVID-19 Main Protease. Methods In silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics techniques were applied to assess the potential for ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin interaction with COVID-19 Main Protease (M pro ). Chloroquine and nelfinavir were used as positive controls.",

For comparison and validation of docking results, we used K DEEP predictor. K DEEP predicts binding affinities using DCNNs and calculates the binding energy \u0394G [kcal/mol] of protein-ligand complexes. In this case, the more negative the \u0394G value of the binding reaction, the higher the binding affinity of the ligand for its specific target protein (Fig. 1) .",

The 3CLpro is automatically cleaved from poly-proteins to produce mature enzymes, and then further cleaves downstream non-structural proteins (Nsps) to release Nsp4-Nsp16, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and helicase [25] .

It should be noted that ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin represent the class of synthetic antibiotics used to treat upper respiratory tract diseases and also in the case of bacterial infections in which the resistance to the treatment with \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and macrolides was developed [26] . Another advantage of fluoroquinolones in the analysed context is their high bioavailability and the large distribution volume. Based on the good pharmacokinetic properties, ciprofloxacin is able to achieve higher concentrations in the target tissues than in plasma, which provides the opportunity for its widely use in the treatment of the respiratory and urinary tract infections [27, 28] . For example, it was noticed that the concentration of the drug after oral administration may reach the value in the lung tissue up to seven times higher than in the serum [29] . Ciprofloxacin can be safely taken at higher oral doses (above 500 mg twice a day) as a long-term therapy and thus different dosage options can be considered [30] . Therefore, the possible dual-mode of action could be especially used in the broad range of antiinfective activities in patients with COVID-19. Due to the fact, that further studies need to be conducted to elucidate the in vitro as well as in vivo efficacy of the tested fluoroquinolones that could strengthen findings reported in the present study, we want to share our results with scientists in anti-SARS-CoV-2 research as soon as possible.",
