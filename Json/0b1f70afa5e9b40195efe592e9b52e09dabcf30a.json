            "text": "INTRODUCTION COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020, and it has spared no region of the world. Early in the epidemic, the greatest numbers of cases have been reported in Asia, Europe and North America, with more recent dissemination within Latin America and Africa. 1 Although South Africa and a handful of other low-resource settings have reported widespread epidemics, limited testing and surveillance capabilities make it difficult to assess how widely the pandemic has spread in such settings. Such regions are believed to be at particular risk of severe epidemics, due to overcrowding, lower access to clean water and sanitation services and inherent shortages in health system infrastructure for detection and management of disease. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This study is strengthened by a large number of observations per clinic, collection of data using research staff and methods external to the programmatic healthcare system (which can be interrupted during external shocks), and longitudinal observation allowing comparison of the preperiod and postperiod. \u25ba The study was conducted within the public health sector of South Africa, and is generalisable to similarly rural, resource-limited settings, and observation during the lockdown period prior to widespread local COVID-19 transmission. \u25ba Our exposure of interest (ie, the lockdown measures) were not randomly allocated, so there is a risk, however small, that a simultaneous exogenous shock could be responsible for the changes in clinic visitation seen. \u25ba The dataset is purely quantitative and focused on clinic visitation events, which prevents deeper exploration of the root causes of trends noted.",

            "text": "In response, most nations in sub-Saharan Africa have implemented non-pharmacological interventions to attempt to prevent large-scale epidemics. These measures, which include restrictions on large gatherings, work and school attendance, travel and in their most stringent forms, shelter-in-place orders, are believed to reduce disease transmission. [10] [11] [12] [13] However, instituting these measures is also associated with deleterious economic and social, impacts, including large projected reductions in manufacturing, access to employment and basic necessities and educational advancement; and these effects appear to be greatest among those in lower-income and vulnerability categories. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Across the sub-Saharan African region, the Economic Commission for Africa projects an approximate 1.4% contraction in gross domestic product and that 25 million people are susceptible to entering extreme poverty. 20 Some have hypothesised that non-pharmaceutical interventions might be less effective in settings with large informal economies and limited ability to respond to increases in cases of severe disease, 21 and that their risks might outweigh their benefits. 22 Of particular concern is how social fear and reduced access to basic public health services might impact morbidity and mortality for non-COVID health conditions. Modelling studies have suggested that even modest reductions in child healthcare access could result in 100 000s of additional deaths in low-income and middleincome countries. 23 Similar concerns have been raised by the Academy of Science of South Africa and others about provision of chronic disease care among adults. 24 25 UNAIDS has warned that non-pharmaceutical interventions could challenge manufacturing and supply chains of HIV therapeutics, 26 and modelling estimates suggest that such disruptions could cause as many if not more HIV-related deaths than COVID-19-related deaths. 27 Although empiric data on health outcomes remain sparse, there have been significant reductions in tuberculosis testing in South Africa during the early phases of the lockdown, 28 indicating an interruption in critical services for the most common cause of death in the country. 29 There is also historical precedent from other recent communicable disease outbreaks. Primary healthcare access was significantly impacted during prior infectious disease epidemics, such as Ebola virus disease, resulting in increases in morbidity and mortality. 30 31 Yet, whether and the extent to which similar effects will be seen during the COVID-19 epidemic is not known.",

Over the following months, the restrictions gradually eased from level 5 down to 4 at the end of April and level 3 at the end of May, which corresponded with lifting restrictions on intraprovince movement, preinitiation of public transportation and allowed for reopening of schools and many business. 32 33 Because the healthcare sector was deemed an essential service throughout the entire lockdown period, no restrictions were placed on access to or delivery of healthcare services.",

These research staff operate in partnership with the Department of Health, but outside of the standard Health Management Information System (HMIS). For each person who presents to clinic, they collect demographic information and the self-reported reason(s) for the clinical visit. We link data between the HDSS and the clinic medical record system electronically using a unifying identification code for each resident of the catchment area.

Notably, visits for chronic disease, such as hypertension and diabetes, perinatal care and family planning remained reasonably constant or modestly increased. However, child health visits for immunisations and growth monitoring dropped immediately by over 50% after the start of the lockdown. With gradual increases over time during level 5 and level 3 lockdown, child visits largely returned to prelockdown levels in June, approximately 3 months after the lockdown began. We noted an estimated 20% increase in clinic visits for HIV immediately after the lockdown and suspect this might have reflected an urgency to collect medications prior to an anticipated interruption in clinic access or medication availability and/or national programmatic efforts to accelerate transitions to a new first-line regimen. 38 These results demonstrate concerning trends about reductions in preventative child care during the lockdown period.

            "text": "The key demographic population in our study that experienced significant drops in clinic visitation was children. Child health visits appeared to have modestly rebounded during the lockdown, and eventually return to their prelockdown state. Although these data do not suggest the cause of reduced visitation in children, multiple possible factors might be considered. We hypothesise that limited options for childcare for families with multiple children might prevent caregivers from being able to bring individual children to clinic. Moreover, in Open access contrast to, for example, HIV wellcare visits, well child visits rarely involve medication refills so might be prioritised lower for families. Whatever the cause, our findings are in keeping with data from elsewhere. In Hangzhou, China, paediatric healthcare visits dropped by nearly 75% during the peak of the epidemic and lockdown periods. 39 In the USA, vaccination rates in children substantially declined after a national emergency was declared in response to the COVID-19 epidemic. 40 Modelling analyses using Lived Saves Tool have suggested that a 15% reduction in maternal and child health coverage could result in over 250 000 additional deaths. 23 WHO has also projected significant increases in deaths due to malaria in children under 5 in endemic regions with disruptions in malaria care and insecticide-treated bednet distribution. 41 Although empiric data on healthcare access in South Africa remain scarce, work to date has suggested significant reductions in tuberculosis testing in laboratory databases, and reports of interruptions in care in community-based surveys. 28 42 Previous disease epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa have also been associated with lapses in primary care access, and drops in facility based births and child healthcare access. 30 31 43 44 Consequently, future work should investigate the impacts of even modest drops in vaccination rates and child health outcomes, to better assess whether the drop we identified resulted in long-term health effects, and whether catch-up vaccination campaigns might help limit the fallout of such interruptions. 45 Maintaining healthcare access during the epidemic requires a careful balance of primary healthcare provision and protection of vulnerable populations from COVID-19 infection. In other settings, there have been multiple reports of late and severe presentations to care for non-COVID-19 conditions, putatively due to decreased access to care or fear of nosocomial infection at healthcare facilities. [46] [47] [48] At the time of our data abstraction at the end of June during the level 3 lockdown period, fewer than Open access 200 cases of COVID-19 infection had been reported in uMkhanyakude District. 49 Thus, our data largely reflect impacts of lockdown measures prior to an epidemic with significant local transmission. Clinics in this district instituted symptom screening at the entryway to clinics, with referral of individuals meeting criteria for persons under investigation to regional COVID-19 testing centres. Future work should revisit the impacts of the epidemic itself on access to primary healthcare. The COVID-19 epidemic has also led to calls for decentralised care to minimise exposure for high-risk populations, 50 including those with chronic non-communicable disease, HIV, a history of tuberculosis-related lung disease and those of older ages. The lockdown was instituted rapidly in South Africa, before substantial decentralised care systems could be put in place. However, an important unanswered question is how such programmes will affect access to care and epidemic transmission in high-risk populations, including the elderly and those with immunosuppressing conditions.",

These effects are likely to fall most heavily on those in the informal economy. 51 South Africa has taken steps to increase social support to counteract economic disruption from the epidemic and control measures. 52 Mitigating long-term consequences may require governments and development partners to increase access to employment and other social support services during the epidemic.",

Second, our study was able to access data collected across 11 clinical centres within a large HDSS, which provided significant power to detect even small interruptions to healthcare access.
