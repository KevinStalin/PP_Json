            "text": "Although value co-creation concept has captured much interest, especially in the tourism and hospitality fields, limited empirical studies have been conducted to explore the complexity of experience value co-creation process in the online tourism review platform context. The current study will fill the research gap by proposing usergenerated platforms as a contributor to the online co-creation process (platform engagement: pre-travel) and how this co-creation experience enhances a travel destination's image and, subsequently, impacts on the travel experience (destination engagement: at-travel). It employs a holistic model which incorporates platform-use experience, platform co-creation experience, travel destination image, and overall destination satisfaction. A total of 342 surveys were collected from travellers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Structural equation modelling analysis showed that perceived usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, aesthetics and homophily were important determinants for platform co-creation experience. Positive and significant relationships also existed between platform co-creation experience and cognitive and affective images. These images were also found to influence respondents' travel satisfaction. These findings contribute to a better theoretical understanding of the role that UGC platform use experiences play in the overall platform co-creation experience, and how this impacts on destination image formation and subsequently, satisfaction. Managerial implications, limitations and suggestions for future studies are also discussed.",

Filieri (2015) reported that 80% of online users planned their holidays online, visited more than 20 websites, and spent more than 2 h on average searching for travel information via social media. Contemporary travellers study other travellers' reviews or comments on the travel forums, travel blogs or social media platform (Zhang, Gordon, Buhalis, & Ding, 2018) and perceive these peer-to-peer reviews as more reliable compared to the marketing material on the DMO's website or related sources (Gal-Tzur, Bar-Lev, & Shiftan, 2020) . These reviews from other travellers uploaded on travel forums, personal blogs, travel-related websites, social media or video-sharing sites for the views of other online users are called as user-generated content (UGC), (Ayer, 2015) . Today, popular UGC websites such as Trip Advisor, Expedia, Yelp.com, AirBnB.com, and Thorn Tree by Lonely Planet have become the 'go-to' for travellers planning upcoming holidays.",

            "text": "There is already a dearth of research on UCG, studies primarily focus on predictors that influence online users acceptance of UGC (e.g. Assaker, Hallak, & El-Haddad, 2020; Ayer, 2015; Ayer, Au, & Law, 2013a; Mendes-Filho, Mills, Tan, & Milne, 2018) ; UGC's impacts on travel organisations and destination marketing (e.g. Baka, 2016; Marine-Roig, 2017; Taecharungroj & Mathayomchan, 2019; Zhang, Zhang, & Yang, 2016; \u00d6 nder, Gunter, & Gindl, 2020) ; and user intentions to engage into online travel communities (e.g. Ben-Shaul & Reichel, 2018; Bilro, Loureiro, & Guerreiro, 2019; Filieri, 2015) . However, little research has been conducted to examine the crucial role that UGC websites play in facilitating the successful sharing of UGC to its intended audience. This has prompted a few researchers to propose that this new service-dominant (SD) logic paradigm must be explored from different theoretical underpinnings (Payne, Storbacka, & Flow, 2008; Zhang et al., 2018) . Furthermore, in the review of the previous UGC studies, Ukpabi and Karjaluoto (2018) revealed that UGC has transformed online users from passive recipients to active participants in the online service co-creation. The current study will aim to address this gap in the literature at examining the role of UGC websites in the tourist co-creation process. Payne, Storbacka, and Frow (2008, p. 86) propose that UGC may be considered co-creation because it is \"dynamic, interactive, non-linear and often unconscious processes\" between the users and other parties. Reviews which are generated by other travel-users may considered as contributing to the online value co-creation experience, serving as a micro-foundation for value co-creation (Storbacka, Brodie, B\u00f6hmann, Maglio, & Nenonen, 2016) . UGC websites serve as an important intermediary between the posters and the users of UGC (Cabiddu, Lui, & Piccoli, 2013; Neuhofer & Buhalis, 2012; Prebensen & Xie, 2017) as well as the destination (Buhalis & Foerste, 2015; Ferrer-Rosell, Coenders, & Marine-Roig, 2017; Zhang et al., 2018) . Through interactions with other users on these UGC websites as well as the website interface itself, studies have argued that users experience value co-creation (e.g. Harrigan, Evers, Miles, & Daly, 2017; Islam & Rahman, 2017; Zhang, Hu, Guo, & Liu, 2017) . Zhang et al. (2018) further asserted that more research is needed on better understanding the role of platform-use experience on the online value-co-creation experience. In their study, the authors demonstrated that an online platform's characteristics such as website usability and trust have significant effects in tourists' emotional experiences and behavioural intentions. Thus, the current study aims to add to the literature by examining how platform-use experience on UGC sites impact on co-creation experience while using the website.",

Xia, Zhang, and Zhang (2018) suggested that online experiences affect users' travel image in a mobile online experience context. Furthermore, Yang (2016) claimed that tourists' interactions and co-creation experiences enhance the image of the destination. Destination image may serve as basis on which travellers base their evaluations of the destination (Narangajavana, Callarisa, Tena, Artola, & Garcia, 2019; Wang, Hao, Law, & Wang, 2019) . At the destination, tourist evaluations of the destination are based on pre-conceived imagery of what they would experience at a destination (Kladou & Mavragani, 2015; Prayag, 2009; Wang & Hsu, 2010) . Thus, TDI serves as a crucial evaluative criterion on which tourists compare their travel experiences and form satisfaction judgments at the 'at-travel' stage (Chi & Qu, 2008) . Overall, findings of these studies suggest that an integrated model which encompasses platform-use experiences, platform co-creation experiences, travel destination image, and satisfaction may be feasible.",

            "text": "As mentioned in the background, most researchers focus more on the determinants of adopting UGC in their travel planning. As tourism is considered being experiential in nature, potential travellers would be heavily relying on the existing information. The emergence of Web 2.0, information and communications technology (ICT) have provided an easily access yet cheaper alternative for the users to get different travel opinions, personal commentaries and updates from the UGC by the previous users and/or travellers (Narangajavana et al., 2019) . Ukpabi and Karjaluoto (2018) conducted a systematic review from a total of 54 related studies on UGC from 2005 to 2016 which revealed that UGC adoption is determined by most of the attributes which in their study categorised as source, user and content characteristics. The source-based antecedents that influence UGC adoption are source credibility, expertise, trustworthy and homophily. The source origin and the creator's background also play a role in the user's adoption of UGC in travel planning. Second, the user-based characteristics such as gender, age, occupation, and education level influence the UGC adoption. Most UGC studies reveal in their demographic findings that young and middle-aged users dominate UGC platform as they tend to be involved in travel decision-making (not relying on travel operators), curiosity and inquisitiveness (Assaker, 2020; Filieri, 2015; Oliveira, Araujo, & Tam, 2020; Yang, Lee, Lee, & Koo, 2019) . Most of the users in these age groups perceive exploring UGC platforms as fun and enjoyable experience. They are highly involved in exploring different information that could be useful and beneficial for their travel planning. Lastly, users tend to adopt UGC due to the nature of the content itself. The contents which are novel, aesthetics, accurate, genuine, relevant and reliable would drive users' intention to adopt UGC significantly. As such, reviews that are supplemented with videos and photos increase users' online platform-use experience, co-create their own travel itinerary effectively and stimulate a better image ofthe host destination, which will be discussed further in this section.",

In the context of tourism, users share information about their experiences at specific destinations on UGC platforms which result in a collaborative development of value for both the sharers as well as the readers of UGC (Cox, Burgess, Sellitto, & Buultjens, 2009 ). However, the experience of using the websites can also be argued to contribute to the overall online platform co-creation experience. Zhang et al. (2018) explored value co-creation experience on the official online platforms of Nanjing as a travel destination in China. The authors asserted that digital platforms (such as websites and social media) have not only integrated in facilitating user-to-user co-creation, but also facilitate a user-to-interface co-creation experience. They argue that five design quality dimensions (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, aesthetics, trust and interactivity) make up online platform-use-experience, which, in turn, contributes to the value co-creation encounters between tourists and online platforms. In line with this conceptualisation, the current study proposes that the experience of using UGC platform contributes to a broader platform co-creation experience.",

Various empirical studies had been conducted to test the effects of these two constructs towards innovation adoption, however, the findings have been inconsistent. Ayeh, Au, and Law (2013a) , acknowledged as pioneers in UGC empirical research, discovered that PU and PE had a significant effect on UGC adoption for travel planning. Ayeh (2015) further claimed that online tourists' assessment of PU has the strongest impact on UGC adoption intention. However, Zhang et al. (2018) revealed that usefulness was found to have a non-significant impact on online destination emotional experience due to UGC being more on 'cognitive' nature. Further, another study by Balouchi et al. (2017) indicated that ease of use was insignificant towards adopting UGC on travel decision. This was argued to be due to the fact that respondents were already familiar with the internet usability and complexity was not an obstacle. Nevertheless, PU and PEU have been conventionally tested as part of the functions of the value co-creation experience and will, thus be adopted in this study.

Dickinger (2011, p. 379 ) explained that trust can be considered as \"confidence in the interaction with the service provider, trust in the system, in protection of customers' privacy and secure payment\" in the online travel platforms. In other words, a trusted UGC website is one that is perceived by the user as providing honest, sincere, and truthful content. Deceptive or one-sided promotional reviews can be equated to reviews that are perceived as untrustworthy, sponsored or fake (Filieri, 2016) . This is underpinned by the source credibility theory which explains the significance of trust in the absence of legal protections such as a contract between the parties (Kim, Nam, & Kim, 2019) . Previous studies have asserted that UGC appears to be highly trustworthy, showing high levels of perceived integrity by potential travellers and affecting their travel behaviour towards the destination (Dickinger, 2011; Filieri, 2015; Kim & Kim, 2020; Ukpabi & Karjaluoto, 2018) .

In an online context, interactivity applies more to connections that occurs between people and the computer networks and is conceptualised as how online platforms respond to the travellers' needs and wants . In the case of UGCs, interactivity is experienced through the human-machine interactive interface, in which the DMOs, reviewers and other potential travellers interact. This perspective is consistent with the human-computer interaction perspective where Stromer-Galley (2004, p. 393 ) perceived interactivity as a \"product of medium characteristic or interface design\". The function of interactivity has been established as playing a significant role in influencing users' perceived consumption value of a website and online purchase intention (Liao, Chung, & Chang, 2019; Yoo, Lee, & Park, 2010 ).

The theory of social comparison suggests that communications from a similar reference are perceived as being more influential than messages coming from dissimilar ones (Brandenberg, Ozimek, Bierhoff, & Janker, 2019) . In hospitality, Walls, Okumus, Wang, and Kwun (2011) proposed that luxury hotel guests expect other guests to dress identically so that they are perceived as being from a similar social class. In an online context, homophily becomes salient when group of users that have shared interest or mindset towards an object or entity in the online platform (Herrero, San Mart\u00edn, & Hern\u00e1ndez, 2015) . Assaker et al. (2020) claimed that the increasing number of online communities (online groups) reflect the importance of homophily among the users.

Generally, the widely accepted definition would still be Baloglu and McCleary's definition of TDI as the sum of an individual's beliefs, ideas, and impressions of a destination (Baloglu & McCleary, 1999, p. 870) . TDI is formed through a tourist's subjective interpretation of the destination based on various cues and/or stimuli (Chi & Qu, 2008) . Generally, TDI has been modelled based on three dimensions which are widely recognised in the literature. The first dimension is 'cognitive' TDI which refers to beliefs or knowledge about a destination based on a cognitive evaluation, whereas the second dimension is known as 'affective' TDI which refers to the feelings and/or attachment towards a destination (Baloglu & McCleary, 1999) . These physical and psychological images are derived from information of various sources including online platforms prior to visit the destination (Santana & Gosling, 2018 Zhang, Fu, Cai, & Lu, 2014) . Studies have also examined'overall' TDI which measured as the \"result of both perceptual/cognitive and affective evaluations of that place\" or a sum of the two aforementioned dimensions (Baloglu & McCleary, 1999, p. 870) .",

Zhou (2014) conducted a qualitative study analysing popular Chinese online video sharing platforms Baidu and Youku for posts on Wuyuan, Jiangxi. The study revealed that the online imagery and text contribute to the construction of Chinese rural destination images and imaginaries. The strength of this imaginary could be rational and/or emotional interpretations (Pike & Page, 2014) which not only influence tourist's pre-visit decisions, but also has direct and indirect associations on tourist's on-site experience and post-travel behaviour (Kim, 2018; Lam, Lee, Goh, & Samsi, 2017) . In interactions with UGC websites whether favourable or unfavourable form part of the basis of destination's cognition and subsequently conjure up an image of the destination emotionally. For example, a photo uploaded on a UGC platform depicting the Grand Canyon provides travellers with information about what they can expect to see at the destination (cognitive) as well as evoke emotions of excitement or awe (affective). Thus, the platform co-creation experience has potential to impact on the travellers' images of the destination and it is proposed that:",

Then, upon experiencing the destination, travellers conduct an evaluation of the destination based on their pre-experience perceptions which results in either satisfaction or dissatisfaction (Kim & Chen, 2016; Marine-Roig, 2019) . This is further supported by Narangajavana et al. (2019) who proposed that the UGC's impact on satisfaction spans across the 'pre-travel' to 'at-travel' and 'post-travel' phases. Similarly, Wang et al.

To test for convergent validity, standardised loadings for each construct were examined to see if they exceeded the 0.70 threshold (see Table 3 ). While a number of items had loadings were below 0.70, Henseler, Ringle, & Sinkovics (2009) suggested that loadings between 0.40 and 0.70 should be retained so long the composite reliability for the construct is above 0.60; and thus these items were retained. However, a number of few items where the loadings were less than 0.40 were removed from further data analysis.The bootstrap test showed high significance levels for all loadings (bootstrap-based empirical 95% confidence interval does not include zero) with the average variance extracted (AVE) for each construct exceeding 0.50 (see Table 3 ). This indicates that a significant part (50% or more) of the indicators' variance can be captured by the construct, supporting convergent validity (Chin, 1998) .",

Chin, Peterson, and Brown (2008) classified the endogenous latent variables as substantial, moderate or weak based on the threshold R 2 values of 0.67, 0.33 or 0.19, respectively. Accordingly, the cognitive and affective images and overall satisfaction explanatory powers are moderate while the online destination platform co-creation experience has substantial predictive power. Next, the Stone-Geisser's Q 2 values for platform co-creation experience, cognitive image, affective image and overall satisfaction indicators were also computed using blindfolding procedures; all values were above zero (>0), meaning that the model has predictive relevance (Geisser, 1975; Stone, 1974) . This shows that the model was a good predictor of the indicators of platform co-creation experience, travel destination images and overall satisfaction. The predictive relevance's Q 2 relative impact can be categorised within the ranges of 0.02, 0.15 and 0.35 reveal a small, medium or large predictive relevance (Hair, Risher, Sarstedt, & Ringle, 2019) .

Aesthetics may enhance the online experiences, promote greater adoption and their repeat behaviour of the UGC platform (Huang, Chang, Yu, & Chen, 2019; Pallud & Straub, 2014) . Homophily was also found to significantly and positively predict online platform co-creation experience. This also confirms with the findings revealed by Assaker et al. (2020) that the level of similarity displayed by other users on the UGC website is an important impetus in promoting the acceptance of the UGC which in turn contributes to the platform co-creation experience in an online context. In other words, the more users perceived congruence between their own interests and the interests of the other users on the platform, the more positive the co-creation experience. Interestingly, a non-significant result for trust on platform cocreation experience was noted. This contradicts the findings of previous study that have suggested that trust in the UGC platforms' information would positively contribute to the online value co-creation experience (e.g. Zhang et al., 2018) . Similarly, most UGC studies reveal that trust is the most significant antecedent for UGC adoption compare to other variables (Ukpabi & Karjaluoto, 2018) . A possible explanation for this phenomenon is that most of the respondents already have a good impression of established online UGC platforms (e.g. TripAdvisor, AirBnB). User skepticism may be further minimised as UGC platform content is often screened by administrators and other users also offer corrections should the content be irrelevant or incorrect. Thus, they considered trust is not a major issue in the co-creation experience, particularly if it is a prominent platform with established group of reviewers and followers. Furthermore, users are aware of the possible risks and uncertainty for using travel review open-platforms where the UGC creator's identity could be anonymous, fake or manipulated (bib_Assa-ker_et_al_2020Assaker et al., 2020 . In addition, interactivity was also found to be insignificant in the study which is interesting given the imperative of interactivity in the co-creation process (bib_-Liao_et_al_2019Liao et al., 2019 bib_Yoo_et_al_2010Yoo et al., 2010 . Zhang et al. (2018) offer a potential explanation for this by arguing that interactivity is more crucial in human-to-human interactions where bonding is emphasised compared to 'human-machine interaction'. Platform co-creation experience was found significantly and positively impact on cognitive TDI cognitive image as well as affective TDI, supporting the findings of previous studies in the area (e.g. Kim, 2018; Xia et al., 2018) . Thus, information on UGC platforms is able to elicit both cognitive as well as affective expectations about what they envisaged experiencing at the destination. This study's findings revealed that UGC platform co-creation experience enhances cognitive perception on Kuala Lumpur's travelling activities, natural beauties, authentic street food, renowned heritage attractions and various kind of entertainment (especially in the lively vicinity of Bukit Bintang). These attributes confirm with an earlier study's results on Kuala Lumpur's city image where Jaafar, Ismail, and Khairi (2020) found out that international tourists visited Kuala Lumpur due to the attributes of place attractions, food, local people, shopping and architecture. Al-Shams and Badarulzaman (2014) opined that Kuala Lumpur is well-known for some of its modern architecture (e.g. Kuala Lumpur Tower and Petronas Twin Tower) and heritage landmarks which date back to nineteenth century (e.g. Sultan Abdul Samad Building, Sin Sze Si Ya Temple '\u4ed9\u56db\u5e2b\u723a\u5edf' and St. Mary's Cathedral). However, those previous studies on Kuala Lumpur's image were conducted without examining the role and influence of UGC and online platform co-creation experience.",

For destination managers, this suggests that homogenous groups of users tend to gravitate to specific UGC platforms, offering an opportunity to better understand the grievances of these segments' through their UGC. For instance, Tripadvisor has introduced 'The TripAdvisor Connect' ads on Facebook and Instagram which adds an additional layer of targeting different segment of users, active on those social media platforms. These ads are using Facebook's targeting features and TripAdvisor's users who are clustered into different profiles or identities accordingly (e.g. outdoor enthusiasts or 'beachgoers'). Destination managers may trace these ads to identify the strengths and weaknesses of their destination offerings as highlighted in the UGCs. Furthermore, this also allows destination managers to respond to criticisms on these websites to reduce the detrimental effects of negative reviews as well as to build more positive engagement with their target markets. Tripadvisor reported that, if a manager provides personalised responses to the reviews, over threequarters (77%) of its users in its online survey were more likely to have the revisit behaviour (TripAdvisor, 2020).",

First, while the current study aims at developing an initial theory in the examination of the linkage between UGC platform co-creation experience, destination image, and satisfaction, there is a need for further studies to validate its findings. It is noted that the current study examines the phenomenon broadly and does not compare between specific types of UGC platforms (e.g. TripAdvisor, Booking.com, etc) . It is possible that individual websites possess unique qualities which may not be generalisable to other platforms to be included in the research. Furthermore, it would be prudent to examine other forms of UGC platforms such as blogs, microblog, media-sharing sites (e.g.YouTube) or even the effects of mobile versions of UGC platforms to validate the findings of the current study. In addition, 'in-house' review platforms controlled or owned by the DMOs could also be included for the comparison analysis.",
