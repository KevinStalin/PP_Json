For Cort\u00e1zar, reading was a transforming impulse, part of a process of liberation from mental ties to which he contributed as an author, challenging the barrier between the fantastic and the real, the limit between the human and the animal, between the living and the inert. Thus, as a critic on blind Modernity, Cort\u00e1zar, from his stories, questions anthropocentrism in a gesture that in the current crisis of the Anthropocene could not be more topical. Moreover, while he supported the transformation of people's material conditions of life in Latin America, he innovated and celebrated literature in intermedial texts that are the decanted result of a creative performance, embedded in the strongly transcultural context of a diaspora that was first voluntary and then became exile.",

            "text": "Finally, by taking into account its biographical anchorage, Cort\u00e1zar's work presents a third level of access in terms of its materiality. The author developed his literature as part of a personal search that emerged from the metaphysical-aesthetic world and eventually became part of a historical process that aimed to change the material conditions of reality (cf. i.e. \"Acerca de Rayuela, \" Cort\u00e1zar in Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga 2009, pp. 173-174) . Thus, the following pages focus on these three perspectives in order to unravel how Cort\u00e1zar \"mentors\" the reader into freedom through the materiality of his texts. Julio Cort\u00e1zar was born in Brussels (1914) , raised and educated in Argentina, and passed away in Paris (1984) . As an author, he consciously proposes to the public an epistemic and aesthetic gain through his literature, subverting the logic by which we usually perceive and construct reality. This is one of his most crucial objectives and can be traced back to his initial aesthetic searches; later, it even became one of his goals for political transformation. The study of his manuscripts might give an idea about how the author leads the reader into a different perception of reality, since all writing activity encompasses ordering procedures that allow for the materialization of ideas (cf. Raible 2004, p. 198) . As Sybille Kr\u00e4mer and Wolfgang Raible state, authors become their own readers along a way in which the \"unordered and simultaneous whole of our mental ideas and thoughts\" (Kr\u00e4mer 2004, p. 27 ) is concretized, put in order and externalized into a medium; then reconstructed, checked and compared with the intention underlying the process (cf. Raible 2004, p. 202) . This process is not limited to literary authorship; to a certain degree, it can also be extended to any usual writing activity (cf. id., pp. 200) . Based on the analysis of works by Marcel Proust, \u00c9mile Zola and Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, Raible unravels the way in which the ideas of writing experts become text and how an epistemic-and aesthetic-gain is produced in this process (cf. ibd., pp. 202-212) .",

Yurkievich specifies: \"I've had the chance to see his manuscripts and verify that his stories were born from a trance that shaped them completely. There are almost never second or third versions and corrections are always scarce.\" (ibid.). Cort\u00e1zar had claimed to reflect little or nothing when writing a story or poem, to have the impression that \"they had written themselves\" (id., p. 211); unlike his novels, whose writing process have been more systematic \"to carry out action delayed by reflection\" (Cort\u00e1zar [1967 (Cort\u00e1zar [ ] 1995 . In \"Del cuento breve y sus alrededores,\" a brief essay on literary work and the 'handicraft' of short stories found in \u00daltimo round (Cort\u00e1zar [1969 (Cort\u00e1zar [ ] 2009a , his reflections focus mainly on the closeness of the characters and the feeling of anguish and liberation that writing produces. According to the author, stories are creatures that breathe (id. 78), from which-and not through them-the communication between author and reader takes place, being the author, in this process, the first reader in amazement of himself (cf. id., p. 79). Through his unorthodox way of ordering reality, Cort\u00e1zar builds a close relationship with the reader, from whom he needs complicity and shrewdness in order to invoke the revealing power of imagination (cf. Yurkievich [1994 Yurkievich [ ] 2004 .",

            "text": "It is precisely its interest in the inorganic that represents the new element of this orientation (cf. Hennessy 2017, p. 99; Coole and Frost 2010, p. 7) . Together with cultural post-humanism, i.e. by Rosi Braidotti or Karen Barad, they promote a focus on relations between and throughout the species, as well as on \"the vitality and agency of nature\" (Coole & Frost, ibid) . To these interweaving perspectives should be added the closely linked postulates of Latin America's \"Buen Vivir\" and the cosmologies of the native peoples, in which air, water, soil, animals and plants are considered to be invested with agency. This present confrontation of an anthropocentric standpoint is obviously chained to the long process of illuminating the dark side of the subject of Enlightenment (the white European man) and questioning the limits of Cartesian reasoning and its consequent divisions and hierarchies, as well as the construction of an \"Other\" as a constituent element of Modernity. This line of questioning, and the social criticism implied by it, is also recognizable in artistic and cultural movements of the early twentieth century, such as Surrealism, which offers an important critique of rationalism in Cort\u00e1zar's thought. 5 The positions held by Surrealists were far from purely aesthetic; rather, their proposals for individual and socio-political transformation went hand in hand with artistic and literary innovations (cf. Vanbroeckhoven 2019, pp. 38-40) . As Joel Vanbroeckhoven points out, Cort\u00e1zar identified with the worldview of the Surrealists, although not with their methods (id., p. 58). Furthermore, from the 1930s onwards, when Surrealism was already \"domesticated,\" the Sur magazine brought Existentialist philosophy to Buenos Aires, especially of French origin, and Cort\u00e1zar contributed to its dissemination (cf. Yurkievich in Yurkievich et al. [1994 ] 2017 ). In the intersection between both currents that pervaded in this period, Cort\u00e1zar formulated his Teor\u00eda del T\u00fanel (1947 , Cort\u00e1zar in Yurkievich et al. [1994 ] 2017 . In it, he proposes that literature is the total expression of the human being, a \"modo verbal del ser del hombre\" (a verbal mode of man's being, ibid., p. 57), and that the [true] writer-poet distrusts and challenges language as a \"perfecta, infalible m\u00e1quina de enunciaci\u00f3n\" (perfect, infallible enunciation machine, id., p. 62). Although the author himself described-retrospectively-this period of his intellectual work as reduced to aesthetic interests, there are several clues that allow us to recognize, from very early on, Cort\u00e1zar's wish to promote an integral transformation of the reader through literature-initially, perhaps, relying mainly on aesthetic means. The literary presence of Cortazar's work bears the stamp of the (anti-)novel that consecrated him in 1963, Rayuela (engl. Hopscotch). In it, Cort\u00e1zar questions the usual construction of reality at the level of the structure, its literary motifs and the language used. The concerns that he expresses in his masterpiece, however, date from much earlier. After reading his correspondence, it can be argued that his intense friendship with the poet and globetrotter Fredi Guthmann had a profound and lasting impact on the writer and builds a major contribution to his intellectual pursuits. The letter dated from July 26th 1951 reveals Cort\u00e1zar's goal set in one of the deep-rooted conventions of Western thought:",

            "text": "A veces, con lo que pueda yo tener de poeta, entreveo fulgurantemente una instancia de esa Realidad: es como un grito, un rel\u00e1mpago de luz cegadora, 5 Joel Vanbroeckhoven reconstructs Cort\u00e1zar's position back to the Belgian (post-)surrealists, with whom the author clearly agreed more than with the French (cf. Vanbroeckhoven 2019). Based on the aesthetic resources and themes presented in his work, Evelyn Pic\u00f3n Garfield characterized Julio Cort\u00e1zar in her study as a \"Surrealist, in spite of himself\" (Pic\u00f3n Garfield 1975 , p. 250 in Vanbroeckhoven 2019 . In this context, it is important to take into account the role of Jean Cocteau, who, as it is well known, never declared himself to be a Surrealist. Jean Cocteau deeply inspired Cort\u00e1zar through his artistic and human searches (cf. Cort\u00e1zar's translations of Cocteau's oeuvre and his statements about Cocteau's Opium, for instance, in Prego Gadea 1997, p. 69; Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga 2012a, p. 252; 2012b, p. 607). una pureza que duele. Pero instant\u00e1neamente se cierra el sistema de las compuertas; mis bien educados sentidos se reajustan a la dimensi\u00f3n del lunes o del jueves, mi bien entrenada inteligencia se ovilla como un gato en su cama cartesiana o kantiana. Y el no\u00fameno vuelve a ser una palabra, una bonita palabra para decirla entre dos pitadas al cigarrillo. No importa, Fredi; mucho es ya saber que esa realidad est\u00e1 ah\u00ed, del otro lado. (Sometimes, with what I may have of a poet, I glimpse an instance of that Reality: it is like a scream, a blinding flash of light, a purity that hurts. But instantaneously the system of floodgates is closed; my well-educated senses are readjusted to the dimension of Monday or Thursday, my well-trained intelligence is curled up like a cat in its Cartesian or Kantian bed. And the noumenon becomes a word again, a nice word to say between two puffs of the cigarette. It doesn't matter, Fredi; it means a lot to me to know that this reality is there, on the other side. Cort\u00e1zar in Bern\u00e1rdez & \u00c1lvarez Garriga 2012a, p. 321) In a letter dated a few months before Rayuela's publication, Cort\u00e1zar reveals to Fredi Guthmann that the novel is inspired by the dialogues he had with him and that its central character, Horacio Oliveira, reflects \"tu humor, tu enorme sensibilidad po\u00e9tica, y sobre todo tu sed metaf\u00edsica\" (your humor, your enormous poetic sensitivity, and above all your metaphysical thirst, Letter from June the 6th 1962, Cort\u00e1zar in Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga 2012b, p. 285). Cort\u00e1zar confesses that, although the novel is only partially autobiographical, \"he puesto todo lo que siento frente a este fracaso total que es el hombre de Occidente\" (I have put [there] everything I feel in front of this total failure that is the occidental man, ibid.). In fact, after publishing his magnum opus, it is not the \"noumenon,\" but the socio-historical conditions of Latin Americans that started concerning Julio Cort\u00e1zar more and more. However, his early reflections on occidental logic and the value of perception and intuition marked his thinking largely to the end, albeit his ideas on transformation having increasingly included, later on, the socio-political and historical spheres, the material conditions of human life. In the prologue to his last long interview, given in 1983, Omar Prego Gadea quotes that Cort\u00e1zar's \"intention was to hold together what he called 'the revolution from the outside and the revolution from within'\" (1997, p. 32 ).",

            "text": "In his masterclass on literature, given at Berkeley in 1980, Julio Cort\u00e1zar looked back on three phases of his development as a writer. He defined them respectively as his aesthetic, metaphysical and historical stages. At the predominantly aesthetic stage, his passion for literature led him to read \"the best books\" available in Buenos Aires and to write with certain models in sight or with \"un ideal de perfecci\u00f3n estil\u00edstica profundamente refinada\" (ideals of profoundly refined stylistic perfection, Cort\u00e1zar in Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga [1984] 2016, p. 17) . At that time, when he was a distant witness of the Spanish Civil War and, later, of the Second World War, Cort\u00e1zar took sides with the Republicans against Nazism, but he never thought that his role as a writer would allow him to go beyond a position, a commentary or simply beyond his sympathy towards one of the combatant groups (cf. ibid.). Once in Europe, that is, from 1951 onwards, a stage of \"autoindagaci\u00f3n lenta, dif\u00edcil y muy primaria\" (slow, difficult and very primary self-inquiry, id., p. 20) began. His investigation on the human being \"como destino, como camino dentro de un itinerario misterioso\" (as a destination, as a path within a mysterious itinerary, ibid.) becomes gradually manifest. This search is recorded in his novels Los Premios and Rayuela, and is especially embodied in the latter through the aforementioned figure of the protagonist Horacio Oliveira. The third stage starts with his visit to Cuba in January and February 1963, when he was invited to participate in the jury of Casa de las Americas. This visit became a turning point and made Cort\u00e1zar a fervent defender of the revolutionary cause in Latin America. Years later, in one of his last interviews, Cort\u00e1zar admitted that until the moment he became politically aware, he had been indifferent to the political ups and downs of the world and its protagonists, \"[\u2026] yo me quedaba afuera de la parte que correspond\u00eda a la sangre, a la carne, a la vida, al destino personal de cada uno de los participantes en esos enormes dramas hist\u00f3ricos\" (I had remained outside the part that corresponded to the blood, the flesh, the life, the personal destiny of each of the participants in those enormous historical dramas, Cort\u00e1zar in Prego Gadea 1997, p. 211) . After Cuba and back in his country of residence, France, Cort\u00e1zar recognized himself not only as an Argentine author, but also as a Latin American. Moreover: Me di cuenta de que ser un escritor latinoamericano significaba fundamentalmente que hab\u00eda que ser un latinoamericano escritor: hab\u00eda que invertir los t\u00e9rminos y la condici\u00f3n de latinoamericano, con todo lo que comportaba de responsabilidad y deber, hab\u00eda que ponerla tambi\u00e9n en el trabajo literario. (I realized that being a Latin American writer meant fundamentally that one had to be a Latin American who writes: one had to invert the terms and the condition of the Latin American, with all that this entailed of responsibility and duty, one had to put it also in one's literary work. Cort\u00e1zar in Bern\u00e1rdez & Garriga [1984 During a time of strong political effervescence and dichotomous positions, imposed by the Cold War, his claim to being a Latin American writer while having chosen to live in Paris (he even applied for French citizenship) earned him profound criticism from the Latin American intelligentsia. Two people were especially harsh moments in their criticism of Cort\u00e1zar: David Vi\u00f1as and Liliana Heker. The writer and literary critic David Vi\u00f1as found Cort\u00e1zar's understanding of his place of enunciation as a revolutionary and a Latin American unreliable (cf. Vi\u00f1as 1971, pp. 27-34; Letter to Sa\u00fal Sosnowski, dated September 29, 1972, Cort\u00e1zar in Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga 2012d, pp. 318-322; cf. Goloboff 1998, pp. 144-147) . Some years later, Liliana Heker would criticize the comfort of his exile in Paris during Argentina's last dictatorship (cf. Heker 1980, pp. 3-5; Letter to Liliana Heker, dated November 26, 1980, Cort\u00e1zar in Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga 2012e, pp. 312-316; Cort\u00e1zar in Yurkievich 1984a, pp. 16-25) .",

Before the mass exiles due to the multiple Latin American dictatorships (through which the condition of exile affected many politically engaged persons), the discussion around the non-resident countryman was based on mistrust and revealed a difficulty in understanding the migrant's place of enunciation. Moreover, the cultural influence of the European metropolises constituted a common place for cultural criticism and accompanied the discourse of social emancipation. So, for instance, despite having proven themselves to be profoundly anti-fascist during the Second World War, the members of Revista Sur were also criticized for their so-called 'foreign tastes' and were mainly considered to be part of the cultural establishment, being disliked because of their elitism and conservative or anti-Peronist positions.",

His writing on the materiality of existence, the necessary incorporation of the social location, the speaking out from \"the blood, the flesh, the life\" (see above), is also known in feminist studies as \"situated knowledge\" (Haraway 1988 ). In dealing with knowledge positions, Haraway is concerned-above all-with the critical review, deconstruction and interpretation of the dominant knowledge (cf. Haraway 1988, p. 584) . In recent decades, these postulates have coincided with the proposal made by Latin American cultural studies to decolonize epistemology, culture and thinking.

Years of intense social commitment follow, including his participation in the Second Russell Tribunal on Latin America, and from 1979 onwards, supporting the Sandinista revolution against Somoza in Nicaragua. 6 His political commitment had since been expressed in a series of texts.

In 1974, he received the M\u00e9dicis \u00e9tranger prize for Libro de Manuel as the best foreign book published that year, and donated the amount of the prize to the Chilean resistance.

The space of transition emerges when \"osmosis,\" or \"convincing articulation,\" of the fantastic occurs (ib., p. 82). For the writer, this is like a balancing act between two poles. On the one hand, in order to be extra-ordinary, the fantastic has to draw attention inside a common context, because \"solo la alteraci\u00f3n moment\u00e1nea dentro de la regularidad delata lo fant\u00e1stico\" (only the temporary alteration within the regularity reveals the fantastic, ib., p. 79). On the other hand, to create the possible reality effect, the fantastic must be established for a certain time as a new partial order (cf. ib., p. 81). However, the proportion of this order is not immovable. In his definition of the fantastic, Tzvetan Todorov writes that the fantastic lies in the moment of hesitation, \"the text must oblige the reader [\u2026] to hesitate between a natural and a supernatural explanation of the events described\" (Todorov [1970 (Todorov [ ] 1975 . He refers to this interstitial instant as the moment in which the reader is not able to discern whether s/he should decide to consider what s/he has read as uncanny (and supernatural) or wonderful (and extraordinary). In an interview with Mario Vargas Llosa, in 1965, Cort\u00e1zar stated that, as an author, he doesn't even make such a distinction: \"Yo no s\u00e9 d\u00f3nde empieza o termina lo real y lo fant\u00e1stico; en mis primeros libros prefer\u00ed insertar lo fant\u00e1stico en un contexto minuciosamente realista, mientras que ahora tiendo a manifestar una realidad ordinaria dentro de circunstancias con frecuencia fant\u00e1sticas.\" (I don't know where the real and the fantastic begin or end; in my early books I preferred to insert the fantastic into a thoroughly realistic context, whereas now I tend to manifest ordinary reality within often fantastic circumstances.

            "text": "According to Cort\u00e1zar specialist Jaime Alazraki, the fantastic content of the short stories reveals the same question formulated in his novel Rayuela: the confrontation between a secondary reality and an everyday reality that masks it (cf. Alazkari 1983, pp. 211-212) . After reviewing the studies on the fantastic done by Roger Caillois and Tzvetan Todorov, and on contemporary art by Umberto Eco, Alazraki showcased that Cort\u00e1zar exposes the permeability of the border between the real and the fantastic and teaches how \"the real\" depends extremely on our capacity to perceive the world. With his appreciation of what he calls the neo-fantastic, Alazraki proposes that Cort\u00e1zar works with two geometries (1983, pp. 114-120) : he starts from an order that we can call the real or the causal, and transcends it, creating \"a new order that contains the previous one, but that is also situated above it. From this new perspective, the horizon is widened by discovering planes and relationships invisible from a realistic perspective\" (Alazraki 1983, p. 119) . Unlike the fantastic, the neo-fantastic does not confront the reader with her/his fears, but with the logic s/he applies to measure the limit between reality and unreality (cf. Alazraki 1983, p. 35) . The matter can be summarized in the very own words of the writer, who, on having recognized writers such as Edgar Allan Poe as references to his work, explained: \"[\u2026] esa disposici\u00f3n a lo fant\u00e1stico que me asalta en los momentos m\u00e1s inesperados y que me lanza a escribir como la \u00fanica manera de cruzar ciertos l\u00edmites, de instalarme en el territorio de lo otro\" (this disposition to the fantastic assaults me in the most unexpected moments and hurls me to write as the only way of crossing certain limits, of settling down in the territory of the other, Cort\u00e1zar in Alazraki 1994, p. 61, my italics) .",

The questioning of anthropocentrism brings together the texts analyzed herein, since: \"en el siglo XX nada puede curarnos mejor del antropocentrismo autor de todos nuestros males que asomarse a la f\u00edsica de lo infinitamente grande (o peque\u00f1o)\" 8 (in the twentieth century, nothing can better cure us from anthropocentrism, which is the author of all our evils, than to look into the physics of the infinitely large (or small), Cort\u00e1zar 1967, p. 25, my italics) . Dismissing anthropocentrism and thinking in planetary terms occupies a prominent place in the agendas of the beginning of the twenty-first century. In the age of the Anthropocene, that is to say, in which human beings act as a geological force that largely models and destroys earth, climate, environment and life, it appears adequate to examine Cort\u00e1zar's critical imagination against anthropocentrism from the perspective of a new materialism. The Anthropocene concept makes visible the interweaving of nature, society, culture, material life and technology, drawing attention to a human being that, in spite of her/himself, is part of a whole and not its center, nor its culmination point. Both short stories referred to henceforth were published in Final del juego (End of the Game), Cort\u00e1zar's second collection (cf. Cort\u00e1zar [1956] 2016). The book was initially published in Mexico in 1956 and included nine stories, among them \"Axolotl\" (cf. Goloboff 1998, p. 107). Final del juego's current version dates from 1964 and contains material written between 1945 and 1962; most of the stories have in common the persistent theme of the 'otherness' (cf. Pic\u00f3n Garfield 1975, p. 30 ).",

A relatively recent publication includes readings of \"Axolotl\" that analyze the construction of otherness in terms of animal logic (Gremels 2016) and in relation to the cultural coordinates of the primitive/exotic (Bernales Albites 2016). Other readings of this story have emphasized its double plot (Di Ger\u00f3nimo 2001), the manipulation of the reader's gaze (Garc\u00eda Moreno 2001) and its character as an exponent of a dialectic between Dantesque and Aztec mythology (Graf 2002 )-or as an ethnographic allegory (Camayd-Freixas and Gonz\u00e1lez 2000), an idea that had already inspired Knight and Krull to discover a hidden Indian in the story (1973) . Furthermore, Planells put his magnifying glass on its communicative configuration (Planells 1976) and Jaime Alazraki analyzed the axolotl mainly as a metaphor (1994, pp. 69-70) .",

But this fantastic effect can also be thought of as an example of the expansion of the limits of perception, as a challenge to the usual cultural coordinates and as ways of conjugating a different relationship with the environment. For Rosi Braidotti, Humanism postulates \"otherness as non-human, non-white, non-male, non-young, non-normal, non-healthy, non-heterosexual: it is a minus, a minus-one type of thinking\" (Braidotti 2018, 00:05:30) . From the perspective of a post-anthropocentric post-humanism, Humanism's subject is criticizable for constituting himself dialectically through his \"other\" and instrumentalizing difference to create hierarchies, thus placing himself at the top of that order. The animals represent his counterpart; they occupy the other side, the negative place par excellence: \"The animal is the necessary, familiar and much cherished other of anthropos.\" (Braidotti 2013, p. 68) .",

In its structure and plot, the story is an example of sphericity as circularity. From the very first 9 Bernardez Albites draws attention to the significant value of axolotls and of the Jardin des Plantes to the West. The latter is the most important botanical garden in France and hosted studies from which a taxonomy of the primitive and exotic was organized. The axolotls exhibited there were the first specimens to be brought to Europe, within the context of the French intervention in Mexico, in 1863. At the time when Cort\u00e1zar wrote \"Axolotl\", the axolotls of the Jardin had been in a state of confinement for almost a 100 years (cf. Bernardez Albites Bernales Albites 2016, pp. 99-100). paragraph, we become aware of a process that has already taken place and that the story will barely detail. It anticipates the long visits of a man, an independent human subjectivity, to an aquarium, his recurrent thoughts about axolotls and makes an explicit mention of the place of enunciation as a result of the process: the narrator, that is, the one who successfully communicates with the reader, is an axolotl. The last paragraph explains the solitude of an apparently independent axolotl subjectivity and refers to the beginning of the story: outside the aquarium, a narrating self is given the task of telling the story of this encounter which, as we know from the beginning, is not written by a man but by an axolotl.",

The story postulates a disturbing thesis: between human beings and axolotls, there is a vital continuity.

The story does not operate with the usual idea of terror, but with the chilling intuition of a forgotten unity and continuity. The truly disturbing feature of this story is the implementation of the experiment Rosi Braidotti postulates. The merging of human being and axolotls opens up the reader's imagination to a continuity that confronts the reader with the imposture of human supremacy, thus challenging human uniqueness.",

In this regard, a very dramatic-even drastic-situation that demostrates the thing-power is refered to in \"No se culpe a nadie,\" the second tale of Final de juego, published for the first time in 1964, in the second extended edition of the book (see above). In it, a blue sweater becomes an actant and a death trap, inducing a man to kill himself by jumping from the twelfth floor of a building. Bennett includes in her reflections a thinking that goes beyond the living, taking into account the matter that surrounds us and noting how we exchange properties with things (cf. Bennett 2010, p. 10) . In this story, Cort\u00e1zar seems to follow the same impulse, starting from a situation that is well known to all. Who has not once fought a hand-to-hand struggle with a rebellious piece of clothing that refuses to come on, a fight from which we are sure to emerge victorious? Here the expected end is reversed and the melee is won by the usually inert matter, putting its condition into doubt. The object acts in a close, fast and successful fight to death.",

Think of self-driven cars or military robots, such as drones or smart bombs, and the complex ethical debates related to their decisionmaking. 11 Thus, the geometry of another reality does not enter into \"No se culpe a nadie\" through elements that, in 1964, were only imaginable through the literary genre of science fiction, 12 but through skin contact with the blue wool of a sweater that induces a body transformation and that, finally, provokes the self-destruction of the human being.",

Under \"normal\" conditions, the blue pullover would be characterized as suffocating; the feeling of drowning in a garment is well-known. But the pullover is given agency and a will of its own. The attribute of suffocating is translated into willingness to suffocate. The pullover's will is transmitted through contact with the skin, in analogy and yet different from \"Axolotl,\" where the fusion process starts through visual perception.",

            "text": "The narrative situation is apparently simple. An omniscient extra-diegetic narrator is able to flow together with the protagonist's subjectivity and read his sensations, thoughts, desires. In its structure, the story is spherical and constituted as a closed parenthesis of action that concludes with the fall of the protagonist into the void. The sphericity is here supported by a striking syntax, which builds up the struggle's speed. Narrated in a single paragraph marked by rhythm, the story alternates between the protagonist's difficulties in putting on his pullover and the search for futile rational explanations for what is happening. As the protagonist's desperation grows, the sentences-very verbal-are prolonged, mimicking and reproducing a feeling of acceleration, logically due to the absence of full stops. In the edition used here, the last sentence, which ends in suicide, takes up 52 lines and is a vortex that leads to the tragic faith. At the end, reference is made to the title, \"No se culpe a nadie\"/\"Don't you blame anyone,\" especially to the word nadie (anyone) which points at what should be blamed: the thing. Jane Bennett wonders if inorganic bodies can also have a life of their own and whether materiality itself can be vital (2010, p. 53) . She then argues that 'objects' appear as such because their becoming proceeds at a speed or a level below the threshold of human discernment (id., p. 58). So how does Cort\u00e1zar compose this takeover of a man by a banal everyday object, the level of 'willingness' of which is below our perception? The conditions for the awaking of things are equally trivial and already announced in the story's first sentence: \"Cold weather always complicates things a bit, in summer you're so close to the world, skin against skin [\u2026] fall is nothing but putting on and pulling off sweaters, closing oneself in, keeping distances\" (Cort\u00e1zar ([1967] 1998), p. 110). One might say that, in the story, the pullover moves between the human being and the world. Even more: the closer the pullover-which in the course of the story will interweave with the protagonist-the more the world moves away.",

The murderous intent of the pullover can be glimpsed at the very moment the blue wool comes into contact with the skin on the face, nose and mouth (\"stifles him more than he could possibly have imagined, forcing him to breathe deeply,\" ibid. p. 111). The blue wool acts and interacts with the skin and the protagonist's sense of taste: \"while the wool becomes wet against his mouth, it will probably run and stain his face blue\" (ibid.); \"there's also the taste of the sweater, that blue taste of the wool, which is probably staining his face now\" (ibid.). The interaction between skin and mouth with the blue wool produces a new tangible reality: \"if he opens his eyes his eyelashes bat painfully against the sweater (ibid.).\" Skin and wool have interwoven and formed a unit that acts against the protagonist's will and causes him pain: \"[\u2026] the sweater has stuck to his face, with the damp glueishness of his breath mingled to the blueness of the wool, and when the hand pulls upwards it hurts as if something were ripping out his ears and wanting to tear out his eyelashes\" (id., p.112). The blue wool takes over the protagonist's right hand, impeding his liberation from the pullover and finally: \"He opens his eyes carefully and sees the five black fingernails hovering over his eyes, and he has just enough time to lower his eyelids and throw himself back\" (id., p.113). At the end, the pullover and the protagonist's own hand have definitely turned against him and the only option is to flee, \"to reach at last some place, without the hand, without the sweater\" (ibid.). Therefore, the protagonist throws himself out of the 12th-floor window.",

Although a psychological reading of this story may prevail, the metaphor of the claw, however, arises from the transposition of the qualities of an object into flesh, proposing a fusion of man with the environment, beyond any causality. From this perspective, in \"Don't you blame anyone\" Julio Cort\u00e1zar, a detractor of anthropocentrism, experiments with \"a common materiality\" and \"a wider distribution of agency,\" \"chasting the fantasies of human mastery,\" as Jane Bennett and the new materialists have suggested in recent years (cf. id., p. 122).",

The artist's books appear with the European avant-garde and have great repercussions in Latin America thanks to their dissemination through magazines. In them, artists cross \"the borders between visual arts and literature\" in order to relate more directly to the recipient (ibid., p. 31). They propose \"their own codes for the reorganization of the work\" (ibid., p. 32). Dadaism, in particular, offers great space to the absurd and to improvisation, using techniques such as collage and ideograms, as well as new typographies. Surrealism favors the emergence of book-objects, enriching the relationship between poetry and plastic images (cf. ibid., pp. 38-39). With the expression other books, Mexican poet and essayist Ra\u00fal Ren\u00e1n designated those books that \"are not something new, they have always been close to man's creativity, they prepared the appearance of the formal book\" (Ren\u00e1n 1988 , p. 19 in Luna Chavez 2014 .

Produced in an era of antiestablishment counterculture, they establish an immediate connection with a minor and popular genre; but the term almanac also has an autobiographical relevance and links the books to the annual Peuser Almanac, one of young Cort\u00e1zar's favorite readings (cf.

Letter to Francisco Porr\u00faa of August 22, 1966, Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga, 2012c, p. 331) . Its format was born with the very idea of the book, as Cort\u00e1zar asked Julio Silva to participate in its layout, \"[\u2026] ser\u00e1 una especie de almanaque de textos cortos y muy diversos, un libro para cronopios\" ([\u2026] which will be a kind of almanac of short and very diverse texts, a book for chronopes., Letter to Julio Silva, August 23, 1966, Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga, 2012c, p. 333) . Through Cort\u00e1zar's correspondence, it is possible to get Julio Silva's answer to his suggestion: \"Me emociona y me alegra pensar en trabajar en esto von vos.\" (I'm excited and happy to think about working with you., Letter to Julio Silva, September 6, 1966, Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga, 2012c, p. 334 ). Silva's visual proposal is subordinated to the texts, as Silva confirms: \"The images always came after [the text], as a support\" (Silva in Poll 2013, p. 145) . The correspondence between both artists shows, however, their willingness to go through a joint creative process, which would run from the summer of 1966 to December 1967 (cf.

Poll 2013, p. 140) , La vuelta al d\u00eda is articulated around the idea of travel, while \u00daltimo Round is a collage. The figure of composition of La vuelta al d\u00eda is, at the same time, the most obvious intertextual reference, which can be read from the title and has great autobiographical weight: it is the work of the other third Julio participating in this voyage, Jules Verne, and his Vuelta al mundo en ochenta d\u00edas (Le Tour du monde en quatre-vingts jours, 1873). Graphically, Verne's presence is evident in the nineteenth-century style of the drawings, some directly extracted from his original books. When asked about the very clear reference to Jules Verne in La vuelta al d\u00eda, Julio Silva explains it in terms of Cort\u00e1zar's autobiographical context and states that, for the author, imbued since his childhood in a world of books, the French author had the image of a tutor father (Silva in Poll 2013, p. 148) .",

This generated a certain discomfort in the author, perceptible in the explanations that Cort\u00e1zar provided to his publishing agent and editor in Argentina, Francisco Porr\u00faa (cf. Letter to Francisco Porr\u00faa dated September 23, 1968, Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga 2012c, p. 624) . By that time, however, the title \u00daltimo Round had already been decided upon, after both Julios brainstormed in Cort\u00e1zar's summer house at Saignon in Southern France: \"Se va a llamar \u00daltimo round, que juega con round de box, o sea vuelta (\u00faltima vuelta de la pelea-\u00faltima vuelta del d\u00eda, \u00bfves?)\" (It's going to be called \u00daltimo round, which plays with a boxing round, that is, a round (last round of the fight-last round of the day, do you see?)., Letter to Julio Silva dated August 28, 1968, Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga 2012c, p. 611). The most intense writing stage took place during the following Summer in Provence and, by the end of September 1969, the samples were completed (cf. Letter to Julio Silva dated September 25, 1969) . Little can be read about the creative process in the correspondence, but it is clear that both authors shared, in Saignon and Paris, stages of deep mutual exchange.",

In addition to being an exceptional means of expression \"with a playful capacity for action and reaction\" (Silva in Poll 2013, p. 142), collage breaks, primarily, with conventional reference frames and encourages seeing/perceiving in a deeper sense. This other view of things is part of Cort\u00e1zar's avant-garde heritage, which is exemplified by another of his tutelary figures, Jean Cocteau and his work Opium, an author's book that strongly inspired Cort\u00e1zar (cf. Prego Gadea 1997, p. 68f.) .

It includes the diary with poems, called \"Uno de tantos d\u00edas de Saignon\" (One of many days of Saignon, Cort\u00e1zar ([1969] 2009a), pp. 16-39), the poem \"Passage d'Oisy\" (ibid., pp. 40-41), the short prose \"Patio de tarde\" (Patio in the afternoon, ibid., p. 42), and the photograph-text \"aqu\u00ed habita la poes\u00eda-los cronopios versus el sistema\" (here lives poetry-chronopes vs. the system, ibid., p. 43). The sequence is unified at a literary and graphic level by the composition figure \" horse.\" At the end of the chapter \"Uno de tantos d\u00edas de Saignon,\" we see the photograph of a horse (there are signs indicating that it is an Argentinean Creole horse) that looks at the camera; that is to say, it looks at us (ibid., p. 39). The same photograph, yet inverted, illustrates the poem that follows the prose \"Passage d'Oisy,\" this time in white on a black background. Whoever reads \"Patio de tarde,\" the next piece of text, will probably become the victim of an illusion, ending up under the impression that the protagonist of the story is a horse. In this brief and ambiguous narrative, one protagonist, Tobi, \"remueve la cola\" (in Spanish \"cola\" can mean both glue or tail, \"remover\" to clear or to stir) as he watches a blonde girl pass through a courtyard. Cort\u00e1zar's well-known wink appears only in the last lines, which disambiguate the hypothesis of the horse: \"mete el pincel en el tarro y sigue aplicando la cola a la madera terciada\" (he puts the brush in the jar and continues to apply glue to the plywood, ibid.). The wink is completed at graphic level at the bottom of page 43's photograph, which closes the sequence \"aqu\u00ed habita la poes\u00eda-los cronopios versus el sistema\" (here resides poetry-chronopes vs. the system, ibid., p. 43). The photograph was taken by, among others, a certain \"Rocinante\" (Don Quixote's horse) and sent to the narrator in June 1969 by some cronopios from Venezuela (cf. ibid.). The horse/rider composition appears also in the text as a literary motive, announced by the constellation rancho/landscape and, from page 33 onwards, is clearly in correspondence with the couplets (ibid. p. 36 and 37), as well as with the memory of having learned to ride a horse on the back of Prenda (ibid., p. 37).",

Another sequence of photos shows the characters of the narration (id., p. 21) and, on the next page, there is a photo of Julio Silva painting a canvas (id., p. 22), followed by a zoom-in picture of his hand in the following page (id., p. 25). On a double page, one can see a photo of a Mediterranean village, probably Saignon (id., . In spite of its declared anchorage in French Provence, \"Uno de tantos d\u00edas de Saignon\" is a cosmopolitan author's diary about his activities and conversations with intellectual friends of different nationalities and languages. They do not cease to consider current issues, among which Alfred Jarry's P\u00e8re Ubu and the Bolivian President Ren\u00e9 Barrientos, which are mixed up with the Vatican's opposition to the contraceptive pill, the CIA, a soccer game in Buenos Aires, the sunset in Saignon, a tango by Gardel, the verses of Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed and Atahualpa Yupanqui's albums, along with numerous literary, artistic and musical references. The prose has its significant self-reflexive milestone at noon, dispelling the illusion of reality that literary chronology may create: \"Ser\u00e1 \u00fatil indicar que este diario se escribe al final de la jornada y que es un reader's digest, con perd\u00f3n de la palabra\" (It will be useful to indicate that this diary is written at the end of the day and that it is a reader's digest, if the pun may be forgiven, id., p. 18). While at a formal level Cort\u00e1zar tries to permeate the expectations of the reader in terms of literary genres, opening his perception to an array of images, types of letters and diverse literary texts, at the level of content a similar effect is produced here. French Provence appears to be interpenetrated by both the urban cosmopolitan intellectual world and the Argentine pampas of the youthful years of rural teacher Julio Cort\u00e1zar. Thus, the cosmopolitan inhabitant of a Provence ranch evokes himself as a recent immigrant in France at a caf\u00e9 in a corner of Paris 20 years before (in \"Passage d'Oisy\"), from where he zooms in again, 16 years back, on the pampas, Chivilcoy, the coplas of the gauchos and the Creole horses: Y si digo al mismo tiempo es cierto, porque en ese Par\u00eds del 51, ya tan lejos del campo argentino del 35, una tarde en que andaba por la rue St.-Ferdinand la sombra de Prenda me cay\u00f3 encima con su olor a pasto y a cojinillo sudado, entr\u00e9 a un caf\u00e9 del lado del Passage d'Oisy y escrib\u00ed un poema donde todo se daba a la vez, como se me estaba dando\u2026 (And if I say it all at once it's true, because in that Paris of 51, already so far from Argentine's countryside of 35, one afternoon when I was walking along rue St.-Ferdinand, the shadow of Prenda fell on me with its smell of grass and sweaty saddle seat cushion, I entered a cafe right by Passage d'Oisy and wrote a poem where everything happened at once, as it came to me., ibid., p. 37) This is how the \"exploded forms and signal heterogeneity\" referred to by Yurkievich are reproduced both at a graphic and literary level, in a constant interconnection of fragments that continually creates new meanings. Together, these three texts show an attempt to disarticulate standards, in a fight to broaden the reader's horizon to new and diverse levels of perception, creating bridges with the public that, in turn, allow them to establish new relationships between its contents.",

In their pocket editions-and surely even more in their original first editions-the almanac books can be considered as a coagulated, frozen performance: the book as the result of an experimentation process at a high literary and artistic level. The expression \"performance\" is used here according to German philosopher Sybille Kr\u00e4mer's postulate: the idea of the aesthetizing performativity as a dimension of all cultural practices produced from the tension between an event and the perception of it, \"to the extent that this relationship can be described in such a way that what an actor produces is received by viewers in a way that goes beyond the symbolism and expressive properties of that performance\" (Kr\u00e4mer 2004, p. 21) . 13 This is the case with Julio Cort\u00e1zar's and Julio Silva's multifaceted proposal, which goes hand in hand with a reception that necessarily overflows it. Cort\u00e1zar would thus describe La vuelta al d\u00eda\u2026 to the scholar Graciela de Sola: \"Es una especie de ba\u00fal, de almanaque. [\u2026] En resumen, este libro es un divertimento, donde las ilustraciones y el texto juegan un ping-pong que puede agradar al lector sensible\" (It is a kind of trunk, a calendar; [\u2026] In short, this book is a divertimento, where the illustrations and the text play a ping-pong game that can please a sensitive reader., Letter to Graciela de Sola dated June 3, 1967, Bern\u00e1rdez and \u00c1lvarez Garriga, 2012c, p. 442) . The reading is nourished by returning again and again to its poetic, absurd, sensitive, humorous and exciting lines and images, the one and the other in a miscellaneous, fragmented and, yet, intertwined relationship; a ping-pong materiality, exploited and opened up to a sensitive public.",
