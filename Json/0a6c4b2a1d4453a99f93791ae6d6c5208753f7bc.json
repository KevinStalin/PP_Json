The synthetic repurposing of drugs may prove to be more useful than the single repurposing in terms of reducing toxicity and enhancing efficacy. However, the researchers have not given it serious consideration. To address the issue, a novel datamining method is introduced and applied to repositioning of drugs for hypertension (HT) which is a serious medical condition and needs some improved treatment plans to help treat it. Results: A novel two-step data mining method, which is based on the If-Then association rules as well as a novel discrete optimization algorithm, was introduced and applied to the synthetic repurposing of drugs for HT. The required data were also extracted from DrugBank, KEGG, and DrugR+ databases. The findings indicated that based on the different statistical criteria, the proposed method outperformed the other state-of-the-art approaches. In contrast to the previously proposed methods which had failed to discover a list on some datasets, our method could find a combination list for all of them. Conclusion: Since the proposed synthetic method uses medications in small dosages, it might revive some failed drug development projects and put forward a suitable plan for treating different diseases such as COVID-19 and HT. It is also worth noting that applying efficient computational methods helps to produce better results.",

Drug repurposing or drug repositioning process, which may be the best option to treat diseases, brings about some big advantages as follows: First, it may make the finding treatment plan against HT a cost-effective and time-saving process. Second, it might be useful in treating both the orphan and rare HT diseases such as COVID-19, considering the fact that drug companies cannot afford to develop new molecular entities or cannot develop a suitable medication in a reasonable time order. Third, it might prove that the existing drugs have many hidden medical benefits in treating HT, in view of the fact that such advantages have not been detected before.",

In contrast to a single therapy, a proper combination of drugs can produce much better synergic effect and have more control over the disease. However, the drug-drug adverse reactions are considered to be the main challenge in front of the researchers [9] . iii) It may pave the way for developing a new research branch of drug repurposing and expanding the drug usages in a wide range of diseases [10] , which in turn can help pharmaceutical companies or pharmacologists determine the doses of drugs and address their technical issues. iv) The results obtained from the synthetic repurposing of drugs may also be applied to a combination therapy, in which a drug can increase the effectualness of one particular drug when combined with it [11] . There is a marked difference between the synthetic treatment and combination therapy concepts. The first one is based on a synthesis of different drugs instead of a given medication, whereas the second one combines one or more medications with a given drug [12] . In other words, in the synthetic repurposing method, a combination of two drugs (A and B) is used instead of a given drug (C), whereas in the combination therapy, a combination of a given drug (C) and another drug (E) is being used.",

Overall, until recently, three types of machine learning methods, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised have been applied to the scope of drug discovery processes [15] . It has been also shown that some modified and improved versions of the present approaches such as deep neural networks could yield better predictive models [16] , and overfitting and insufficient amounts of data have been the main challenges in front of the researchers who have been engaged in generating an appropriate predictive model [17] [18] [19] . ii) The theory-based researches: normally, researchers formulate the relationship among the biological entities based on the numerical and experimental experiences [20, 21] . For this purpose, they have proposed many mathematical equations to calculate the drugs' structural similarities [22, 23] and based on the similarity score, they have examined the role of the analogous drugs in treating diseases [24] . The fact that the drugs with similar structures (scores) might be replaced with one another, is of the utmost importance. However, it has been reported that the theorybased methods are not applicable to the most projects and to qualify, they need to meet some other criteria [25] . iii) The graph and network theory-based researches: these studies employ a graph or a network to show the communication among the biological components [26] . For this purpose, first the graph algorithms are applied to the generated network [27, 28] , and then the hidden relations are detected [29] . Although these techniques are confronted with minimal validity challenges and can produce significant results, they are not applicable to the most drug repurposing cases because the biological elements act according to the hypergraph concepts [30, 31] . iv) The text mining-based researches: in these studies, different algorithms are applied to delve into a massive volume of raw data and gather the desired ones [32] . The prevalent drug repositioning strategies which are employed to apply this approach, are as follows: K-means, KNN, the association rules, and optimization algorithms [33, 34] . For best results, it is essential to organize the data effectively and apply the state-of-the-art algorithms. Our proposed method, which employs both the association rules (If-Then) [35] and the novel discrete algorithm (Trader), fits into this category of the related works. v) The ensemble method-based researches: in such research projects, various techniques are combined in several different ways [36] to generate an efficient tool for predicting and discovering the hidden benefits of the drugs [37] . For example, some researchers have mixed different aspects of the computational methods to obtain a suitable predictive model [38] [39] [40] . However, from the biological perspective, it has been shown that the simple techniques are sometimes better than the complex ones [41] , and the ensemble methods' overfitting possibilities might be more than the other approaches'.",

Afterwards, the above-mentioned state-of-the-art algorithms were applied to the generated datasets which have been presented in Table 1 . Next, some candidate medicines were selected from medications which have been suggested for use in controlling HT by the different proposed treatment methods. In the datasets, there exist three pieces of information about every drug, which are as follows: i) the total number of a drug's targets, including the main targets and the side effects, ii) the total number of a drug's targets which are effective in controlling hypertension, and (iii) the total number of the drugs which have a target in common with one of the main targets of the specified drug. For instance, in the case of Nicardipine which interacts with 15 targets, only 4 targets play a key role in treating hypertension, and the remaining 11 targets are regarded as just some side effects. There are also 40 drugs which have at least an interaction with the main targets of Nicardipine. The present study aims to substitute a specified drug such as Nicardipine with an optimal subset of drugs which help control hypertension. The results obtained from applying the algorithms to the datasets have been divided into two categories, which are as follows:",

Each algorithm was executed under similar circumstances and invoked the same number of the score functions. Figure 1 represents the convergence of the algorithms on the generated datasets.

Trader is remarkably more stable than the others and delivers better results on the datasets except for Trandolapril and Nicardipine. Moreover, Trader's performance is better than the others' because the performance of the other algorithms lowers through increasing the total number of candidate drugs best possible subset of medicines to cure HT. However, both their performance and their convergence are reduced when the total number of the candidate drugs rises, which in turn can lead to their failure to acquire the best answer to the synthetic repurposing of drugs. For instance, Although the FOA algorithm has acquired the best solution to the Trandolapril dataset, it does not produce the best synthetic medicines on the remaining datasets and therefore falls into the local optima solutions.",

As shown in Table 5 , all of the algorithms have proposed a drug with a few side effects, which may be replaced with Trandolapril. Atenolol, which is used to cure the abnormal rhythm of heartbeats, is a beta-blocker. Like Trandolapril, it interacts with ACE [50].

However, the proposed drugs have a number of side effects and may produce some undesired effects on the body. Trader, WCC, and DSOS managed to find some substitutes without side effects and therefore are better than FOA and CUK. Since Carteolol acts against the beta-2 adrenergic receptor and agonists the beta-1 adrenergic receptor [51] it can reduce the blood pressure; for this reason, it is regarded as a candidate for treating HT.

            "text": "To discover the hidden applications of the existing drugs, a drug repositioning method, which is based on the newly introduced discrete optimization algorithm (Trader) and If-Then association rules, was proposed. The proposed method may reduce the toxicity of drugs and enhance their effectualness in curing diseases. To investigate the applicability of the suggested method, it was applied to the nine hypertension-related datasets, and the results were analyzed and examined from two perspectives. From the first viewpoint, it was shown that the state-of-the-art algorithms yield better outcomes than the others. The average score value and the confidence interval of the proposed algorithm (Trader) were \u2212 7.79 and [\u2212 9.05-6.52], respectively, which were remarkably better than those obtained from the other algorithms. Besides, while the proposed algorithm could detect some candidate lists for all of the datasets, the others failed to do so. For example, the other algorithms except for Trader failed to explore for the potential drugs which can be replaced with Nifedipine and Nisoldipine. From the second viewpoint, the application of the suggested drugs was examined in treating hypertension. A detailed examination of the data yielded some important results as follows: First, the proposed method succeeded in suggesting some proper substitutes for the selected drugs, which may be more useful than the current therapeutic methods in treating HT. For example, the proposed approach managed to replace Atenolol with Esmolol which belongs to a family of beta-blocker drugs and does not have any side effects [56] . As mentioned before, Atenolol can interact with two targets [57] , one of which is responsible for HT, and the next one is a side effect. The small doses of the above-mentioned drugs may combine with their substitutes and produce the desired effect. For instance, in databases, it has been reported that a combination of Trandolapril and Cilazapril might prove more useful in controlling HT [58] . Second, the proposed approach can introduce the novel applications of some drugs. For example, Pinaverium which is a first-line option for curing bowl dysfunctionality, operates as an inhibitor and antagonist of the voltage-dependent calcium channel protein [59] . Moreover, more than 60 countries are exploiting Pinaverium to treat gastrointestinal disorders. However, it still has not won approval from FDA. Pinaverium's application in controlling HT may be based on the kind of method employed in this research. Therefore, the introduced approach might especially revitalize the projects which have already failed due to the various undesired biological effects of drugs [60] . Besides, this method might be a suitable therapeutic plan for treating orphans or diseases because developing an efficient drug is both costly and time-consuming and therefore not affordable for drug companies [61] . Another introduced medication for managing HT is Dapiprazole which is an alpha-blocker agent. Dapiprazol helps to reduce the size of the pupils of the eyes in patients who suffer from mydriasis [62] . Although different studies have reported many undesired side effects of Dapiprazole and some other drugs such as Pinaverium [63] , the proposed approach aims to employ these drugs in an appropriate manner. To this end, such medications are used in small doses to decrease their undesired effects, [64] . Furthermore, a proper combination of drugs might produce a synergistic effect on treating HT [65] . A few studies have investigated the synergic effects of drugs and for this purpose, have examined some drug-drug adverse reactions. However, most of them have not been specified, yet. The machine learning approaches can help predict the drug-drug adverse reactions and introduce the most reliable synthetic candidates.",

(9, 10, and 11), these operators, named retailing, distributing, and importing-exporting, try to improve the CSs. when the retailing operator is employed, the minimum number of changes will be applied to a slave-CS. The distributing operator obtains some values from the best CS of the group (the master-CS) and then, assigns them to the other CSs of the group (slave_CS). While both the distributing and retailing operators change the slave-CSs, the importing-exporting operator brings about changes in the master-CSs. The changes can be accepted in all of the operators, provided that they improve the value of a CS's score. ",
