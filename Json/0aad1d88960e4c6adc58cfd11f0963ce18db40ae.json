The research team also comprised expert 179 qualitative researchers (NH, AR, AS) and a para-sport practitioner (PM). Based on these dimensions of 180 information power, it is estimated that the sample size will be approximately 8 participants.calls will be conducted from the researcher's and participants' homes. Given the current 183 restrictions on contact and social distancing as a result of COVID-19 the ethics committee support the 184 use of an electronic video platform to conduct interviews. 185 Data collection 186 The planned start date for the study is May 2020 and the planned end date is August 2020. Data will 187 be collected via semi-structured interviews conducted by the lead researcher, a female MSc student, 188 enabling participants to give a detailed first-person account of their experiences.[44] One interview 189 will be conducted with each participant via video call between May and July 2020 at a date and time 190 convenient for the participant. This method of online face-to-face interviewing is often more 191 convenient for participants whilst still enabling observation of verbal and non-verbal cues. [52] It has 192 also been suggested that there is little difference in the data quality between online and face-to-face 193 interviews, further supporting the use of video interviews.[53] At least 24 hours prior to participation, 194 informed consent will be obtained for the interview and for audio-recording. As is recommended in 195 phenomenological studies, the interviewer will endeavour to create a relaxed, comfortable 196 environment for the participant and engage them in conversation prior to the interview. This will 197 facilitate the development of rapport and make the participant feel more comfortable and more likely 198 to give a rich account.[54] Prior to the interview the participant will be reminded of the purpose of 199 the research, that participation is voluntary and that they can with suspend the interview at any point. 200 A topic guide (supplementary file 1) informed by existing evidence [31, 37] and conversations with 201 elite para-sport practitioners in Performance Lifestyle and Physiotherapy has been created to guide 202 the interviews. Questions are open-ended and participants will be invited to discuss any concepts or 203 thoughts they feel are relevant. The guide includes introductory questions on sporting background, interviews are estimated to last between 45-60 minutes and will be audio recorded and 210 transcribed verbatim. Cognitive and pilot interviews will be undertaken with approximately two 211 Paralympians from individual sports to assess the understanding and interpretation of the interview 212 questions and refine interview techniques.[55-56] Based on feedback amendments will be to the topic 213 guide if necessary. Field notes will be taken throughout the interviews to provide contextual details 214 and to note non-verbal expressions, aiding data analysis and interpretation. [57-58] A reflexive diary 215 will be used to record the details of the nature and origin of any interpretations which emerge through 216 the interview process; aiding trustworthiness.[45] A copy of the transcript will be emailed to each 217 participant to enable member checking. Each participant will be able to add any further reflections or 218 make alterations, ensuring an accurate representation of their perspectives and experiences, adding 219 to the transparency of the research.lead researcher will be responsible for analysing the interview data because of her experience in 223 competitive swimming and training alongside para-swimmers. In hermeneutic phenomenology, the 224 researchers' biases, assumptions and experiences are essential to data analysis and interpretation, 225 [44-46] supporting the reflexive diary. Participant quotations will be used to illustrate key findings, 226 making the results more credible.[60] Analysis will be carried out immediately after interviews and 227 after approximately 2-3 interviews it will be determined whether the topic guide needs adapting 228 depending on responses to provide more focus. 229 230 The Framework Method (a seven-stage process for qualitative data management and analysis) is an 231 established approach commonly used to analyse qualitative data; hence it is appropriate in examining 232 and understanding lived experience of phenomena. [61] The method highlights the importance 233 involvement of individuals with experience in qualitative research, therefore experienced qualitative 234 researchers will be involved at every stage of analysis (NH, AR, AS). [61] The seven-stage procedure 235 based on that proposed by Gale et al.[61] will be adopted to analyse the data(Figure 1). It is possible 236 that the analysis approach will be subject to change due to the inductive nature of qualitative work 237 and the multiple types of analysis, which involves the immersion of text and initial open coding.",

The methodology was informed by, and the study will be reported in 155 Participants will be para-swimmers who have competed at a Paralympic Games for Great Britain and 156 are actively training and competing.

There will be no age limit and both males and 167 Sample size will be informed by information power as proposed by Malterud, Siersma and 168 Guassora.[50] This is a tool used in qualitative interview studies and is based on the concept that the 169 larger the information power of a sample, the fewer participants are needed.[50] The study aim is 170 narrow, there is high sample specificity and the case analysis strategy suggests few participants are 171 required. This study will follow the theoretical framework and four dimensions of social support 181 Data will be collected via semi-structured interviews conducted by the lead researcher, a female MSc 182 student, enabling participants to give a detailed first-person account of their experiences.[44] One 183 interview will be conducted with each participant via Skype between May and July 2020 and will take 184 place at a date and time convenient for the participant. This method of online face-to-face 185 interviewing is often more convenient for participants whilst still enabling observation of verbal and 186 non-verbal cues.[51] It has also been suggested that there is little difference in the data quality 187 between online and face-to-face interviews.[52] At least 24 hours prior to participation, informed 188 consent will be obtained for the interview and for audio-recording.
