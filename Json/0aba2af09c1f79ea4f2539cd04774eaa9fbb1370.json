NH residents often experience a progressive burden of severe symptoms leading up to death. Aggressive medical care exposes them to iatrogenic complications and poor quality of EOL care, 1 concerns magnified by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, wherein NH residents have taken the brunt of deaths. 2 In a prospective, observational study supported by research grants from the Canadian Frailty Network and Research Manitoba and approved by the Research Ethics Boards of all participating institutions, we assessed ACP processes and practices in 38 NHs in 3 Canadian provinces (10 Alberta, 10 Manitoba, 18 Ontario) recruited for the Better Targeting, Better Outcomes for Frail Elderly Patients (BABEL) study, an ongoing, randomized study of ACP in NHs. Public/private ownership of these NHs is 45%/55%. During 2017-2019, they completed a survey about prevalent ACP practices. Questions explored the frequency of practices on a 5-point Likert scale; for most reporting we grouped these responses into high (always, almost always, or usually), intermediate (about half the time), and low (never, almost never, or rarely).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 461, "end": 462, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Problems With Advance Care Planning Processes and Practices in Nursing Homes"}, {"text": "ACP discussions occur in 92% of participating NHs at initial admission, and yearly thereafter in 97%. In 10%, they are not repeated with changes in residents' clinical status, which is problematic because EOL preferences can change. 3 Frequency of resident participation in ACP discussions is highly variable ( Table 1) ; although this may reflect high prevalence of residents with dementia, the literature supports engaging cognitively impaired residents to the highest degree possible. 4 Nurses very frequently participate in ACP discussions. Physicians participate one-half of the time or less in 40% of the homes; such suboptimal involvement of physicians is recognized as being problematic. 5 Palliative care experts and spiritual advisors are rarely involved.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 233, "end": 234, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 488, "end": 489, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 696, "end": 697, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 311, "end": 319, "text": "Table 1)", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Problems With Advance Care Planning Processes and Practices in Nursing Homes"}, {"text": "In over 80% of the NHs, resuscitation, comfort care, hospital/ emergency department transfers, and use of antibiotics are always or almost always included in ACP discussions.

Possible contributors to such suboptimal performance may include substitute decisionmakers being unprepared for crises, involvement of crosscovering physicians who lack familiarity with prior ACP decisions/wishes, and legally mandated \"levels of care\" documents. The latter identify 3 (to 5) levels, typically including no care limitations, comfort care only, and intermediate tier(s) such as allowing all care except for resuscitation.

The most common are specific paper forms that go with the resident (95% of NHs) and verbal reports to transporting paramedics (in 65%). The most common forms are the \"levels of care\" document mentioned above, with their limitations. Relying on paramedics to transmit ACP information is limited by this same lack of nuance, and, additionally, if they hand off care to emergency department triage nurses rather than to clinicians who will be caring for the individual.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Problems With Advance Care Planning Processes and Practices in Nursing Homes"}, {"text": "Our findings reinforce previously known problems in NH ACP, as well as identifying additional challenges that can contribute to care that is inconsistent with the wishes of these vulnerable individuals.
