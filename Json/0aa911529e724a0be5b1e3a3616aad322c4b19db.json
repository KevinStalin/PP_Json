We searched PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science for case reports and case series about COVID-19 in HIV patients. We finally reviewed 20 case reports including cases of 43 patients with HIV and COVID-19. The mean age of 43 adult patients was 51.56 \u00b1 27.56 years (range 24-76 years). Of these, 30 were male (69.77%), 11 were female (25.58%), and 2 were transgender (4.65%). A total of 25 patients (58.14%) were above 50 years of age. The most common cardiovascular comorbidities were hypertension and hyperlipidemia (48.8%), diabetes (20.93%), and morbid obesity (11.63%). Out of 43 HIV patients with COVID-19, 6 resulted in death (13.95%). All the patients who died were elderly above 50 years and required mechanical ventilation. HIV patients infected with COVID-19 had a high mortality rate. A high burden of pre-existing comorbidities and an advanced age in these patients make them prone to disease progression and worse outcomes.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease , caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. Earlier it has caused diseases like Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) in China in 2002. The single-stranded RNA genome virus has overwhelmed the healthcare system all across the world. People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), advanced age (> 60 years), hypertension (HTN), and diabetes mellitus (DM) are at an increased risk of mortality and morbidity. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) pandemic coexisting with another pandemic like COVID-19 is called syndemic. This group of HIV-positive individuals, who are unable to practice socialdistancing, have limited access to healthcare, and are prone to drug abuse, will be severely affected. The antiretroviral therapy (ART) has helped in prolonging the lifespan of HIV-positive patients, but the concurrent occurrence of COVID-19 and HIV is presenting unique challenges to the management of these patients. Difficulty in the timely refill of ART medications, a restricted visit to doctors, increased stressors like loneliness, loss of jobs, and fear of homelessness could culminate in substance abuse, a rise in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related diseases, and psychiatric problems [1] . The condition could be worse in areas with the already overburdened healthcare system and diversion of public health resources to combat COVID-19. It can make this vulnerable population face unprecedented challenges to maintain their continuity of care [2] . With no cure at hand, practicing social distancing is playing a major role in minimizing the spread of the coronavirus This article is part of the Topical Collection on infection but can result in decreased adherence to ART therapy and the health outcomes of these patients will take a downhill course [3] . Therefore, we aim to systematically review all published cases of HIV patients with COVID-19 and related clinical correlates and outcomes.",

            "text": "The key findings of the current review suggest that HIV patients with COVID-19 infection have a high burden of cardiovascular comorbidities. Furthermore, most of the patients were elderly and male. The most common presenting symptoms were fever, cough, and shortness of breath as reported in COVID-19 patients. Besides, the majority of HIV patients with COVID-19 infection were on ART therapy. The patients who did not recover were mostly elderly (> 50 years) and had cardiovascular comorbidities including HTN, DM, or both. A study by Shahid et al. stated that the older COVID-19 patients with comorbidities such as DM have an increased risk of mortality [24] . Of 6 patients who died, 5 received HCQ with some having a combination of HCQ and/or azithromycin (AZM) and/or 3rd-generation cephalosporins. Of the 37 recovered patients, 11 were on ritonavir (RTV), and 8 of which were on lopinavir (LPV) as well. A study by Yu and colleagues found that influenza-coinfected patients taking lopinavir/ritonavir(LPV/r) treatment had faster pneumonia recovery than those who did not [25] . A therapeutic protective role of anti-HIV agents against COVID-19 infections has been reported [15] . Besides this, high mortality (13.95%) was reported in these patients. Of those that recovered, 17 (39.53%) were reported to be taking a combination of tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) and 3 (6.98%) patients were taking TDF with other combinations of drugs. A study by Amo et al. suggested that HIV-positive patients on treatment with TDF and FTC proved to have a lower risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization [26] . Only 1 out of the 6 patients that did not recover was receiving tenofovir (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) as a combination. ART therapy seems to play a crucial role in protecting HIV patients from COVID-19-related hospitalization. However, key challenges have been reported by this high-risk population in timely accessing preand post-exposure prophylaxis during this pandemic [27] . Policymakers in different countries have proposed and implemented a support framework at a different level to support HIV patients during the COVID-19 pandemic [27, 28] .",
