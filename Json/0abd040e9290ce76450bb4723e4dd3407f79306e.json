Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related multiple-organ failure and ARDS are mainly caused by cytokine storm (6) . Post-viral hyper-inflammation, which begins in the second week of the disease, seems to explain disease severity (7) . Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a recombinant humanized anti-interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R) monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Several arguments show that TCZ administered to patients with severe COVID-19 could be an effective treatment to reduce mortality. By neutralizing a key inflammatory factor in the cytokine release syndrome (CRS), this molecule may block the cytokine storm during the systemic hyperinflammation stage and reduce disease severity (8, 9) . Studies comparing the outcomes of patients treated with and without TCZ are scarce, and include small numbers of patients (10) . We have recently published a retrospective study including 45 patients treated in our hospital, which shows that TCZ seems to reduce the number of COVID-19 severe cases and/or mortality (11) . In this work, we aim to extend this study to our entire J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patient population with confirmed COVID-19 to compare the outcome, especially in terms of need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and/or mortality, between patients treated with TCZ and without TCZ.",

On April 1 st , in relation with the increasing medical literature data, the NFC hospital scientific medical committee including infectious diseases specialists, ICU specialists, rheumatologists, biologists, and pharmacists, approved the off-label use of TCZ in patients with general status deterioration despite well-conducted standard care. Daily \"tocilizumab multidisciplinary team meetings\" were organized to discuss patients' eligibility to receive TCZ. Based on the medical literature, we checked several criteria before starting TCZ treatment: no contraindication to TCZ, confirmed COVID-19 with real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR SARS-CoV-2 RNA, failure of standard treatment, period since symptoms onset \u2265 5 days, oxygen therapy \u2265 4 liters/min, \u2265 25% of lung damages on chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and \u2265 2 parameters of inflammation or biological markers of mortality (with a high level) such as ferritin, CRP, D-dimer, lymphopenia, and/or lactate dehydrogenase.",

Only Capra et al. reported a case-control study which shows that TCZ decreases mortality rate in patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia (10) . In their study, two out of 62 patients of the TCZ group and 11 out of 23 in the control group died, patients receiving TCZ showed significantly greater survival rate as compared to control patients with a hazard ratio for death at 0.035 (95% confidence interval, 0.004 to 0.347; p = 0.004), adjusting for baseline clinical characteristics. In a recent observational, controlled study of 154 patients with severe COVID-19 illness requiring mechanical ventilation, tocilizumab was associated with a 45% reduction in the hazard of death (19). The same kind of results were found by Rossotti et al. in a comparative analysis between seventy-four patients treated with TCZ and 148 patients controls (20). The low number of patients included in our work in the TCZ group may explain that the difference in mortality is not significant because of a lack of statistical power. However, the main reason is probably that we administered TCZ in many cases as a rescue treatment in critical patients who were too old and comorbid to be transferred in ICU. Therefore, the 8 patients who received TCZ and died were not admitted in ICU due to their comorbidities. Furthermore, we have already published that our patients who received TCZ were older, presented more comorbidities and were more critically ill than a control group selected with the same methodology but in a shorter period of time (11) .",
