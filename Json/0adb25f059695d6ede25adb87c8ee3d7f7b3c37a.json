            "text": "With the outbreak of an unknown disease in late 2019 in China, some people became infected with the disease in a local market. Patients were admitted to hospitals with abnormal symptoms, such as fever above 38 degrees, infection, dizziness, muscle aches, and shortness of breath, and cough. Due to respiratory problems and low blood oxygen levels, these people were transferred to intensive care units and many of them lost their lives. The disease was initially completely unknown, but specialists diagnosed the symptoms of the disease as something similar to those of Corona and the flu. The specific cause of this widespread disease was initially unknown, but after laboratory examination and analysis of positive sputum by Real-Time PCR test, viral infection was confirmed and was eventually named Covid-19 by the recommendation of the World Health Organization. This disease was named Covid-2019 with regard to the family of Corona diseases and the year 2019 [1, 2] Over a short period, the Covid-19 epidemic crossed geographical boundaries with a devastating effect on the health, economy, and welfare of the global population. According to the reports of the World Health Organization, Covid-19 showed its severity in 16 to 21% of the patients with 2 to 3% of death [3] . Local statistics in many countries indicate a high mortality rate among patients, and some studies have calculated the mortality rate at 4% [4] . Concerning the novelty of the disease, ways to fight it were not known in the early days, but researchers consider screening and rapid diagnosis of infected patients and their separation from the community of healthy people as an important step in fighting against this disease. Clinical features of Covid-19 include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath, and pneumonia. However, these symptoms do not always indicate and are observed in many cases of pneumonia, leading to diagnostic problems for physicians [5, 6] .",

While the RT-PCR test is the gold standard for diagnosing Covid-19, it has limiting aspects with special features that make it difficult to diagnose the diseases. RT-PCR is a very time consuming and complex manual process and Covid-19 diagnosis processes through this method are very costly and time-consuming. The use of diagnostic test requires equipped facilities and laboratories that do not exist even in many developed countries. One of the drawbacks of this method is the need for a laboratory kit, that the provision of which is difficult and impossible for many countries during crises and epidemics. Besides, the provision of diagnostic kits is difficult and impossible for many countries, because it imposes a huge financial burden on their health systems. Like all diagnostic and laboratory methods in health care systems, this method is not error-free and has bias and error. This diagnostic method requires an expert laboratory technician to sample the nasal and throat mucosa which is a painful method and many people refuse to do nasal swap sampling for this reason [8] [9] [10] [11] . Most importantly, many studies indicated the low rate of the sensitivity of the RT-PCR test, and a number of studies have reported the sensitivity of this method of diagnosis between 30% to 60%, indicating a decrease in the accuracy of the diagnosis of Covid-19 in many cases. Several study these studies pointed to the false-negative rate and contradictory results of this diagnostic test [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

In most recorded cases, the sensitivity and specificity of the CT-Scan test in diagnosing Covid-19 are higher than 94% and less than 60%, respectively, which can lead to problems in diagnosing Covid-19. A study conducted on the diagnosis of patients in Wuhan, China showed that consolidation and ground-glass opacities (GGO) were not observed in CT-Scan imaging in 14% of the images, meaning that 14% of the definitive cases of Covid-19 were misdiagnosed as completely healthy and normal based on their CT-Scan tests. Out of 18 patients with Covid-19 who had GGO with Consolidation, only 12 had GGO and as a result, no consolidation and disease were observed. Despite the presence of consolidation without the advent of GGO in many cases, it was difficult and almost impossible to detect Covid-19.

Hinton showed that the neural network with hidden layers played a great role in increasing the learning power of features. Therefore, these algorithms are able to increase the accuracy of classifying different types of data. Therefore, this field of artificial intelligence has achieved extraordinary success in medical image processing [23, 24] . Deep learning covered the disadvantages of conventional machine learning methods and revolutionized the selection and extraction of features. One of the major applications of deep learning in radiology practices was the detection of tissue-skeletal abnormalities and the classification of diseases. The Convolutional neural network has proven to be one of the most important deep learning algorithms as the most effective technique in detecting abnormalities and pathology of chest radiographs [25] [26] [27] . Since the outbreak of Covid-19, much research has been conducted on processing the related data to deep learning algorithms, especially CNN. Using different algorithms and deep learning architectures, these studies have embarked on the identification and differential diagnosis of Covid-19. In this study, these studies have been systematically analyzed.",

            "text": "It has already been said that one of the diagnostic disadvantages of CT-Scan images in identification cases of Covid-19 its low specificity. Accordingly, the investigation has shown many studies conducted to improve these methods in the analysis of CT-Scan images with deep learning techniques [28, 29, 33-35, 40, 46, 49, 50, 52, 61-65] . Apparently, these methods owe their success in finding pulmonary lesion caused by Covid-19 to the extraction and selection of features hidden in the images. Despite the improvement in the detection and diagnosis of Covid-19 by deep learning algorithms, one of the biggest drawbacks of this modality in the diagnosis of Covid-19 was the lack of this equipment in all medical and diagnostic centers. Furthermore, many patients with Covid-19 required multiple chest images using CT-Scans. Exposure to radiation during CT-Scans causes serious problems for patients Moreover, there is a danger of transmission of the Covid-19 virus from one patient to other people due to CT-Scan tunnel contamination. Therefore, many researchers and physicians have resorted to plain radiographic images or X-rays to diagnose Covid-19. However, these images do not have the resolution and accuracy in diagnosing Covid-19 from the beginning and have many disadvantages in this regard. Therefore, artificial intelligence researchers rushed to the help of clinical experts and used deep learning as a powerful tool to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis of Covdi-19 with X-ray images [22] . Due to the nature of deep learning in the extraction of image features, this technology is capable of detecting patients with Covid-19 and extracting infectious lung tissue, so many studies embarked on a variety of deep learning algorithms to analyze these images [30-32, 36-39, 41, 42, 53, 58-60, 66-71] . In the early days of the Covid-19 outbreak, CT-Scans were more common in diagnosing it, but over time, X-rays also became common. Therefore, research also shifted from CT-Scan image analysis to radiographic image analysis. Figure (3) shows the amount of analysis of the two modalities used to detect and diagnose Covid-19.",

The architectures presented in this figure represent a family of the same architectures or different editions of that architecture. In the texts reviewed, the ResNet architecture enjoyed the most efficacy. However, some of the studies with ResNet 50 architecture achieved the best efficacy in detecting and diagnosing Covid-19, and others used other ResNet editions to maximize efficacy in analyzing radiological images for the diagnosis of Covid-19.

To improve our knowledge, the current review, which uses a variety of deep learning methods to analyze radiological images, is one of the most comprehensive studies in diagnosis and detection Covid-19. The current review provided up-to-date information on deep learning algorithms and their application as an expression of radiographic imaging analysis of Covid-19. Many studies have shown that the use of deep learning algorithms can improve the rate of metric features of CT-Scan images and increase the sensitivity and specificity of radiographic images compared to the radiologist's diagnosis; therefore, the use of this cheap and affordable modality should be considered as a reliable method for the diagnosis of Covid-9. By reviewing 23 research papers on the application of X-ray in the diagnosis of Covid-19 by using deep learning methods, the current modality can be introduced to the scientific and medical community in the field of early and faster diagnosis of Covid-19. By improving imaging methods through artificial intelligence technologies, we can point to the cheapest and safest imaging methods to prevent the transmission of Covid-19. A review of published studies showed that the diagnosis of Covid-19 by deep learning algorithms under the supervision of a radiologist led to an improved efficacy and reduced diagnostic errors in various cases of pneumonia, especially Covid-19. Mean diagnosis of all the studies performed through X-ray modality had a sensitivity with an average higher than 95% and a specificity of higher than 91%, which had a higher rate of diagnosis than that of Covid-19 in traditional texts and methods.",

It is thought that due to the over-similarity of the effects of Covid-19 on lung tissue with different types of bacterial and viral pneumonia, the diagnosis of these diseases through unsupervised methods is very difficult and complicated. The examination of the algorithms and deep learning architectures revealed that almost all studies have used the CNN algorithm; of course, other algorithms have been used along with the CNN algorithm in other studies. The CNN architectures used in these studies all have special features in image analysis, and without adjusting their parameters, it is not possible to have access to the ability of these architectures to detect and diagnose Covid-19.",

In the near future, with the incorporation of deep learning algorithms in the equipment of radiology centers, it will be possible to achieve a faster, cheaper, and safer diagnosis of Covid-19. The use of these techniques in rapid diagnostic decision-making of Covid-19 can be a powerful tool for a radiologist to reduce human error and assist them to make decisions in critical conditions and the peak of the disease. This research supports the idea that deep learning algorithms are a promising way of optimizing health care and improving the results of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Although deep learning is one of the most powerful computing tools in diagnosis pneumonia, especially Covid-19, developers should be careful to avoid overfitting and to maximize the generalizability and usefulness of Covid-19 deep learning diagnostic models; these models must be trained on large, heterogeneous datasets to cover all available data space.",
