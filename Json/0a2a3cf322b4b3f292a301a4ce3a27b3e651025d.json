Past studies of dog lifespan have used academic, corporate or insurance data. While independent primary care data exist for the UK, none have as of yet been published for the US. This study analyzed data from three independent primary care US veterinary hospitals and identified factors that influence lifespan and mortality in a cohort of n = 20,970 privately owned dogs using Kaplan-Meier survival estimators and Cox Proportional Hazards modelling, including body size as a covariate. Results: As previously reported, body size was negatively correlated with lifespan. Gonadectomy was associated with a longer lifespan, with the effect being stronger in females than in males. This lifespan advantage was conserved in gonadectomized female dogs that lived to at least ages 5 and 8 years. We did not find significant differences in lifespan between purebred and mixed breed dogs; however, breeds with larger effective population sizes and/or lower inbreeding coefficients had median survival times 3-6 months longer than breeds with smaller effective population sizes or higher inbreeding coefficients, indicating that these measures of genetic diversity may be affecting breed lifespans. We also found that dog breeds belonging to the \"Mountain\" ancestral group had median survival times that were 3.5-4.6 years shorter than other purebred dog groups, which remained significant even when correcting for body size. Conclusions: Our findings show that it is possible to obtain and analyze data from independent veterinary clinics in the US, an approach that could be useful for studies of comparative epidemiology under the One Health and One Welfare paradigms. We also show that the lifespan effects of gonadectomy are not identical between the sexes and should be investigated separately by sex in future analyses.

Cases seen at veterinary teaching hospitals exhibit referral bias [21] and thus do not accurately represent the average lifespan or most common diagnoses of the entire US dog population. While the large corporate practice database is fully standardized as far as diagnoses are concerned, its use is limited by the fact that the data are proprietary, which means that the raw data cannot be made publicly available. Also, as a single nationwide practice, these clinics exist in neighborhoods of relatively similar socioeconomical and suburban makeup across the country and serve a particular clientele, which again may make their data less generalizable to the total US dog population [18] . The UK VetCompass system represents an example of data accumulated from diverse, non-affiliated private practices [13, 16, 17, 22, 23] ; however, UK dogs likely differ from US dogs in demographics, as is reflected in the differences in breed popularity rankings between the American Kennel Club (AKC) [24] and the UK Kennel Club (KC) [25] . As such, UK dogs may also differ from US dogs in individual disease risks. Finally, studies based on insurance data usually classify diagnoses in a standardized fashion; however, some companies cease to offer coverage after the animal reaches a certain age, providing an incomplete picture of lifespan and causes of death in the population. Furthermore, in the US, less than 5% of owners choose to purchase companion animal insurance [26] , meaning that the use of insurance data to study US dogs would be biased by the characteristics of the small subset of US dog owners who make this choice.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 142, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 756, "end": 760, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 877, "end": 881, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 882, "end": 885, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 886, "end": 889, "text": "17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 890, "end": 893, "text": "22,", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 894, "end": 897, "text": "23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1068, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1097, "end": 1101, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1538, "end": 1542, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Dog lifespan has commonly been studied based on mortality data, in which information is limited to deceased animals and does not include dogs from the same birth cohorts that are still alive at the time the data are collected. This type of analysis causes data to be rightcensored and will generally result in an underestimation of lifespan [27, 28] . If data from dogs that are still alive are available, there are methods that avoid this problem, including Kaplan-Meier analysis [29] and Cox proportional hazards regression [30] , which take into account individuals known to have still been alive at a certain age even if we do not have information on their ages at death. In the case of Cox regression, we can analyze the effects on hazard of death of multiple variables simultaneously. When using these methods, median survival time (MST) can be compared among groups even before all individuals have a documented date of death. MST is likely a more clinically meaningful parameter than average lifespan calculated from only those individuals with known dates of death. Unfortunately, such methods have not been routinely applied to many of the existing studies on dog lifespan and causes of death thus far, which results in artificially low lifespan estimates and limits comparability between studies based on different populations with varying degrees of right censoring [27, 28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 341, "end": 345, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 346, "end": 349, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 481, "end": 485, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 526, "end": 530, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1382, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1383, "end": 1386, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "These issues have resulted in a largely inconclusive body of evidence regarding factors that are associated with lifespan in dogs.

In addition, several studies have looked at the effects of gonadectomy without differentiating between sexes, which may result in the strong effect of female gonadectomy overwhelming the possible lack of such an effect in males, and making it appear that an overall effect exists [34, 35] . Furthermore, the influence of age at gonadectomy has not thus far been studied in any large population comprising multiple breeds. The fact that any gonadectomized dog needs to have lived to the age at which the procedure was carried out may also risk introducing some degree of bias [36] .

In this context, it has also been suggested that the age of gonadectomy should be taken into account when analyzing veterinary epidemiological data [36] . While our data did not include information on age of gonadectomy, we attempted to correct for these issues by also testing the effects of gonadectomy on lifespan using only dogs that were known to have survived to at least age 5. In doing so, we found that the increased survival associated with female gonadectomy was conserved, while the effect found for male gonadectomy across all ages was not conserved in this group.

Additionally, we also performed an analysis of the effects of female gonadectomy using only females that had lived to be at least 8 years old and found that the beneficial effects of gonadectomy were conserved in this population, indicating that the lack of a beneficial effect of gonadectomy on lifespan in female Rottweilers described previously [46] cannot be generalized to a more diverse dog population.

The UK study design is similar to the study reported here and was not subject to recall or referral bias; however, it did not take right censored data into account, which may have contributed to the lifespan appearing to be shorter [27] . This difference may also reflect differences in the health or veterinary care of US vs UK dogs, or it is possible that the three US practices reported here are a biased group in some way and the mean lifespan derived from the larger number of UK practices is more generalizable.
