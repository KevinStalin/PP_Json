Acquired dependencies of tumors are inferred in cases in which one allele is disrupted by inactivating mutations or in association with oncogenic mutations. Nucleocytoplasmic transport by Ran GTPase is identified as a common vulnerability in Her2-positive breast cancers. Vulnerability to loss of Ku70/80 is predicted for tumors that are defective in homologous recombination and rely on nonhomologous end joining for DNA repair. Our experimental validation for Ran, Ku70/80, and a proteasome subunit using patient-derived cells shows that they can be targeted specifically in particular tumors that are predicted to be dependent on them.",

However, the screening methods are applicable only to in vitro cell culture, limiting the discovery of therapeutic targets for clinical samples. A patient-derived cell model cannot be generated in a sizeable fraction of patients. In other patients, the time needed to develop the model is too long for clinical decisionmaking. Furthermore, in the absence of matched normal samples, it is difficult to identify truly cancer-specific dependencies and characterize them in association with somatic alterations.",

Perturbed transcriptomes, not basal transcriptomes, are directly linked to the consequential phenotypes. However, perturbed transcriptomes associated with cell death cannot be acquired experimentally because the expression patterns of only surviving cells will be captured. In addition, experimental data may be too complicated to capture the core changes that actually contribute to growth phenotypes because of biological complexity involving feedbacks and secondary effects. Practically, it is close to impossible to generate transcriptome data for knockdown of individual genes in each sample. Therefore, we need to simulate transcriptomic perturbations and link the resulting expression patterns to the state of cell death or growth.",

Transcriptomes and matching dependency maps constructed for cancer cell lines are used for training. Tumor and matched normal transcriptomes of clinical samples are used as input for prediction. Cancer-specific vulnerability can be identified by comparing the prediction outcomes for tumor and normal samples. The prediction model consists of in silico CRISPR/RNAi and machine learning. For a given transcription profile derived from a cell line or clinical sample, virtual repression can be performed by adjusting the expression level of each target gene and its downstream genes. The perturbed expression profiles are fed into neural networks for training or prediction. The output of the model is the probability that the perturbed transcriptome is associated with cell death or that the survival of the given sample is dependent on the inactivated gene (see the \"Materials and methods\" section) Figure S1A ). These results imply that true dependencies share more distinct patterns in their perturbed transcriptomes.

This pattern was not observed for samples in which both copies were already inactivated (Fig. 4b, right ). Many tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) follow the two-hit hypothesis and contribute to tumorigenesis when both copies are lost or inactivated. Therefore, further suppression of these genes in LOF mutant samples will not cause tumor death. As expected, our DNN method predicted no acquired vulnerabilities for TSGs (Fig. 4c) .

Third, functional enrichment of the overexpressed genes in the RAN-dependent samples was found for nuclear chromatin, ribosome, and spliceosome ( Fig. 5a and Additional file 5: Table S4 ). In rapidly dividing tumors, proteins involved in chromatin formation need to be actively synthesized and transported into the nucleus. The assembly of ribosomes and spliceosomes is reliant on nucleocytoplasmic transport as the proteins are imported into the nucleus and then exported back to the cytosol after coupling with the RNAs. Ran is activated by growth signaling to fulfill this demand [24] . Therefore, rapidly growing tumors should be vulnerable to RAN silencing.",

            "text": "Regarding Ku70/80 dependency, we first tested whether the PD(+)XRCC6 cells rely on the NHEJ pathway. When XRCC6 was inactivated, the PD(+) cells maintained the activity of DNA-PKcs whereas the PD(\u2212) cells decreased the expression of this protein (Additional file 1: Figure S12 ). Indeed, the PD(+) samples were more sensitive to the DNA-PK inhibitor, NU-7026, as indicated by 40-60% lower IC50 values (Additional file 1: Figure S13A~S13B ). This reliance on the NHEJ pathway may reflect HR deficiency. It is known that HR-defective cells are sensitive to DNA-PKcs inhibition [27, 28] . To test this, we challenged the PD(+/\u2212)XRCC6 cells with \u03b3-irradiation to generate DSBs. XRCC6 inactivation led to an increase in the number of Rad51 foci in both the PD(+) and PD(\u2212) cells (Fig. 7c) . However, the degree of the increase of Rad51 foci was 3~4fold lower in the PD(+) cells than in the PD(\u2212) cells (Fig. 7d) . We also performed the DR-GFP/I-SceI HR assay [33] in which the fraction of GFP-positive cells indicates HR activity for DSB repair. While XRCC6 suppression led to an increase in the fraction of the GFP-positive cells (Fig. 7e) , the magnitude of increase was 3~6-fold lower in the PD(+) cells than in the PD(\u2212) cells (Fig. 7f) . The similar results were obtained from the DR-GFP/I-SceI assay in response to the treatment of NU-7026 (Additional file 1: Figure  S13C ). In summary, the PD(+)XRCC6 cells displayed HR deficiencies under high DSB load, consistent with our observation with the TCGA data (Fig. 5b) . These results illustrate how Ku70/80 silencing can render particular tumors vulnerable when the sensitivity to Ku70/80 suppression can be predicted by our computational method.",

As for RAN, we characterized the gene as a contextdependent dependency in association with cell growth (Fig. 5a) .

Later, the sensitivity of BRCA1/2-mutated tumors to PARP inhibitors was broadly linked to HR repair defects [23] . Further studies established synthetic lethality between the HR pathway and the NHEJ gene DNA-PKcs [27, 28, 37, 38] . Our results suggest that HR-defective tumors are also sensitive to the loss of Ku70/80, the interacting partner of DNA-PKcs. Further investigation is required as to whether inhibiting Ku70/80 instead of DNA-PKcs can be more effective at the RNA level. Importantly, sensitivity to Ku70/80 inhibition can be predicted based on transcriptome data by our deep learning model. This approach can be extended to many different cancer types, facilitating the discovery of precision therapeutic targets. Once a prediction model has been established, exome and transcriptome data for tumor and matched normal samples will be sufficient to identify patient-specific vulnerabilities that are associated with somatic mutations or common vulnerabilities that arise in a context-dependent or synthetic lethal manner.",

Normalized GARP score, or zGARP, was used as a metric of dependency [3, 16] .

We employed our previous Bayesian network in breast cancer [11] (Additional file 6: Table S5 ) and the same type of network in liver cancer [14] for a negative control. We constructed another type of regulatory network on the basis of ARACNe (Algorithm for the Reconstruction of Accurate Cellular Networks) [12] (Additional file 7: Table S6 ). We applied the ARACNe software available at http://califano.c2b2.columbia.edu/aracne [39] . From a gene expression profile, ARACNe identifies direct transcriptional interactions on the basis of mutual information (MI). We determined the significance of MI at P = 0.01. In order to simulate the effect of gene suppression, we had to determine the directionality (i.e., which gene regulates which gene) and regulation type (i.e., whether the interaction is activation or inhibition) of the interactions between the suppression target gene and its interaction partners. For this purpose, we utilized conditional probability. For example, when P(X = on| Y = on) represents the probability that gene X is expressed given that gene Y is expressed, the directionality can be determined by comparing P(X = on| Y = on) and P(Y = on| X = on). If P(X = on| Y = on) > P(Y = on| X = on), gene Y is considered to be a regulator of gene X. To determine the regulation type, we used P(X = up/down| Y = up/down) to represent the probability of gene X being up-or downregulated given the up-or downregulation of gene Y. More details are provided in the next section.",

Therefore, we used 1000 random combinations of the parameter values for model selection. The learning processes were based on five-fold cross-validation consisting of five different partitions into training and validation data. For each partition of training and validation data, the best hyperparameter combination was selected based on the AUC on the validation data set. A test AUC was then assigned to the selected model based on an independent test set that was not used for learning. The average test AUC for the five best models was obtained to represent the overall performance. In our tests of the shuffled, inverted, and liver cancer networks, we selected the five best hyperparameter combinations for each split into a training set and a validation set, resulting in five average test AUC values. The mean of these five values was reported. We used the class probability as the \"prediction score\" for the given input. A prediction score close to 1 indicates a higher association of the given transcriptome with cell death. The input transcriptome with a prediction score greater than 0.5 was classified as a dependency profile. Tumor-specific dependencies were identified as having the tumor prediction score greater than 0.5 and the normal prediction score lower than 0.5.",
