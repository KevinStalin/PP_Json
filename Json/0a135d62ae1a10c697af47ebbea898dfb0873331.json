Surgical educators faced a similar choice: cancel mock oral examinations (MOE) or shift to a virtual format. 1 We chose to adapt our MOE to a virtual format, recognizing MOE as a valuable educational and assessment tool that helps residents identify areas of weakness and guide self-preparation for the ABS CE. 2e4 Here, we report our methods for conducting a virtual multi-institutional MOE, faculty and resident perceptions of the virtual format, and challenges unique to delivering a virtual examination.",

The exam day began with a brief orientation. An administrator assigned participants into breakout rooms within one of three Zoom meetings. In each breakout room, 2 examiners facilitated 4 cases in a thematic category over a 20-min time period for one examinee. After this, examiners remained in the same virtual room, and examinees were directed to additional virtual rooms until they completed all 12 cases. At the end of the exam, faculty and residents completed a survey on exam satisfaction, perception of the virtual format compared to the in-person format, and any technical issues encountered. Examinees were scored using 2 separate metrics: average case score in cases completed and percentage of questions passed of questions completed. Examinees failed the MOE if they scored below one standard deviation in either criterion.",
