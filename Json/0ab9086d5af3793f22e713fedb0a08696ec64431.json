            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with high transmissibility. 1 It has caused a pandemic, named coronavirus disease , that has affected more than 3 million people and caused over 200 000 deaths worldwide. The wide spectrum of the disease ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. 2 The majority of patients have respiratory manifestations, and many report gastrointestinal symptoms. [3] [4] [5] Anorexia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are reported in 3-79% of patients. 6 There are abundant viral receptor expressions on gastrointestinal epithelial cells, and recent studies have suggested possible fecal-oral transmission. [7] [8] [9] It has been suggested that preventive measures against fecal contamination should be implemented owing to prolonged duration of viral shedding in stool up to 16 days from symptom onset. 10 The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is composed of 11 countries with a total population of more than 655 million people, ranking third among all subregions in the world. The coronavirus outbreak was recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Thailand announced the first confirmed case outside mainland China during the Chinese New Year on 13 January 2020, and the disease continued to spread widely across ASEAN. 11 Until 30 April 2020, Thailand recorded 66 371 patients undergoing COVID-19 tests, and 2954 tested positive. According to data from the Thai Ministry of Public Health, Bangkok, the capital city of Thailand, had the highest number of COVID-19 cases (51.9%) in the country, followed by Phuket (7.3%), the popular island resort in the south.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on global community since January 2020. The ASEAN was one of the first sites where the virus began spreading, and the number of the infected patients in this region has increased rapidly. 11 In Thailand, more than half of confirmed cases have been in Bangkok or were predominantly clustered in southern provinces (Phuket, Yala, and Songkhla) and Bangkok's surrounding areas (Nonthaburi and Samutprakan). While other studies demonstrated a higher proportion of men, our study had slightly more women than men. 2, 27 This study also confirmed that the presence of comorbidities was significantly associated with more severe symptoms of COVID-19. 3 The gastrointestinal tract is affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. 7, 8 Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) are required for viral entry into host cells. Apart from alveolar cells in lung tissue, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are highly coexpressed in glandular epithelial cells in the esophagus, ileum, and colon. 8 The mechanism through which SARS-CoV-2 causes gastrointestinal symptoms is not clearly understood but is suspected to be involved with ACE2 function. ACE2 naturally regulates homeostasis of intestinal amino acids and gut microbiomes. Altered ACE2 function can result in amino acid malnutrition and diarrhea as demonstrated in ACE2 knockout mice. 28 The prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19 patients in this study was 30%, which was relatively higher than other studies in China. 2, 3, 27 However, prior studies from Singapore showed comparable prevalence of overall gastrointestinal symptoms (37%) and specific symptom such as diarrhea (17-24%). [20] [21] [22] Therefore, COVID-19 patients in ASEAN appear to be more inclined to have gastrointestinal symptoms. The proportion of patients with diarrhea (15%) in this study was almost the same as an earlier study in Thailand (18%). 18 Moreover, our study demonstrated that diarrhea was significantly associated with severe symptoms. The previous study showed that abdominal pain and anorexia were associated with more severe symptoms, while diarrhea was not different between groups. 3 Diarrhea was also described in COVID-19 pediatric patients with mild symptoms in Malaysia. 25 One patient in our study exhibited only gastrointestinal symptoms, and another patient had diarrhea before the onset of respiratory symptoms. Neither patient had fever. The time from onset of gastrointestinal symptoms to hospital admission was 15 and 12 days, respectively. In addition, a case report described an unusual presentation of COVID-19 in a young Indonesian woman with predominant epigastric and chest pain, which was initially treated as gastroesophageal reflux disease. 24 One day later, she developed dyspnea and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. More attention should be focused on COVID-19 patients presenting with only digestive symptoms because of the possible higher risk of transmission during an undiagnosed period. 29 The most common nongastrointestinal symptom was cough (67.5%), which was similar to previous studies. 22, 27 Sore throat was the second most common symptoms in ASEAN (33-82%), whereas China had a lower incidence of this symptom (13.9-17.4%). 3, 18, 27 In conclusion, gastrointestinal manifestations in COVID-19 patients are common presenting symptoms and can occur ",
