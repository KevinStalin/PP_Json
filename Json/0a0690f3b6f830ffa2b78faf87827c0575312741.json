            "text": "In its first 25 years, the journal Advances in Health Sciences Education (AHSE) has become known for pushing boundaries to expand notions of what is recognized as relevant and legitimate in the study of health professions education (HPE). In this special edition, the AHSE community celebrates this success, and honours the legacy of its founding Editor-in-Chief, Geoff Norman. We applaud AHSE for using this occasion to consider ways that the field has benefited from a broad range of theories, methodologies, and disciplinary or interdisciplinary perspectives. True to the spirit of the journal, this celebration invites scholarly questioning of how to further advance HPE. As the world moves beyond traditional approaches to teaching and learning in HPE to more international and interconnected approaches (Harden 2006) , advances to scholarship in our field must include closer attention to the voices and contexts that are absent or under-represented. Questions that shine light on structural barriers that silence certain voices and/or contexts are essential to consider if the aims of HPE are to be international rather than Euroamerican dominated. The AHSE community of scholars is well positioned to share ideas for levelling the playing field in global HPE research and find ways to have more inclusive scholarly conversations.",

We consider the under-representation of certain voices and/or contexts to be an important area of absence that requires further examination. We write this piece as a group of educators and scholars who are part of a longstanding high income country (HIC)-low income country (LIC) partnership between the University of Toronto (UofT) and Addis Ababa University (AAU) . The Toronto Addis Ababa Academic Collaboration (TAAAC) relies on a commitment to long term engagement with a focus on building strong relationships as part of our continued work together. For years, we have reflected together on challenges faced by LIC scholars in sharing their perspectives both at international conferences and in the academic HPE literature. We have worked to develop and abide by principles and values that reduce academic hierarchies within our partnership, while acknowledging the inescapable fact that privilege creates power differentials (Whitehead et al. 2018) .",

In accordance with the requests from AAU, and the urgent need to develop culturally-appropriate training, the early years of the partnership focused on programmatic development and implementation. Scholarship was desirable and welcomed, but mostly happened ad hoc and program by program. Although the primary work continues to focus on collaborating to build new curricula for programs, the last 5 years has seen a growing focus on the importance of creating scholarship about the collaboration. To this end, a TAAAC Master of Health Sciences Education (MHSE) was developed as a means to provide specific education scholarship capacity building with a goal of integrating scholarship into and across all TAAAC programs. This MHSE has now trained four cohorts of education scholars in Ethiopia with an explicit focus on educational issues of relevance in the Ethiopian context. The TAAAC MHSE development is part of an international trend involving universities in HIC and LMIC to develop health professions education scholarship programming to provide capacity-building opportunities for education scholars from under-represented contexts (Frenk et al. 2010; Yarmoshuk et al. 2018) . What remains unique with the TAAAC MHSE program faculty is our commitment to thinking deeply about and implementing equity scholarship based on relational collaborations.",

Unsurprisingly, in moving from the principle of shared representation to the implementation of appropriate processes and practices, we have identified pragmatic, structural, and conceptual issues that remain a work in progress. Two areas of recent negotiation among our partners are in the scholarly processes of grant capture and manuscript development and the subsequent publication process, which can add a special strain on the capacity building process.",

Within our partnership, and particularly with education-focused projects, it is the HIC partners who most often have more access to funding opportunities. Some of these grant opportunities require a HIC principal investigator(s) and collaborators from LIC, but have no requirements for LIC principal investigators. To achieve grant success, projects therefore get framed in ways that highlight the relevance and importance to the calls of the HIC funder from the HIC investigators' priority areas. For example, a recent grant writing experience had us working within the parameters of the grant (only HIC leads required), but in attempts to ground the work in what is relevant to our Ethiopian partners, we worked together early on in the writing process. Nevertheless, the voice of the grant writing and project design was in the end, and by design for likelihood of grant success, written for a 'Western' audience.",

Together we revised and edited the manuscript until it found acceptance in an appropriate journal. Upon reflection, we realized that part of the re-writing process involved 'Westernizing' the voice and the arguments, so that it was judged more appropriate for an international audience. This caused us to reflect about voices and balance. Authors from HIC are more likely to be at ease and fluent with Engligh language academic writing styles. These layers of privilege are extremely helpful for getting a project to the stage of publication submission but they also structurally tilt the dominant voice to be more 'Western.' When the aim is to publish the work in an international English language journal, framing for acceptability and legitimacy can accentuate this tendency. When working with historically marginalized groups, striving for a single 'partnership' voice may not be appropriate (Soklaridis et al. 2020) . One way to acknowledge historical injustices and power imbalances is to add a reflective statement that includes how these complex dynamics play out in the writing process.",

The Lancet, BMJ and BioMed Central (BMC) support improvements of information flow with LMICs by offering both greater open access to peerreviewed research from the international community and increased opportunities to bring their own research to international audiences (Godlee et al. 2000) . These attempts may have contributed to some success. Of the top five international medical education journals, BMC's Medical Education specialty journal includes representation from the greatest range of geographic locations (Costa et al. 2018) .

She describes how this disenfranchises authors from non-English speaking countries in terms of participating in international conversations. While in the TAAAC partnership the English as first language speakers are able to help overcome the language disparity issue in specific scholarly projects, we recognise that even in a partnership, issues around language connect to issues around voice, and to what is valued in determining authorship order. English is the language used in higher education in Ethiopia, and is the language used for the TAAAC partnership work, as Ethiopian scholars can function well in English. Canadian scholars speak at most a smattering of Amharic words. All translation from Amharic is work done solely by Ethiopian scholars. This includes finding ways to express sophisticated Amharic concepts in English. The painstaking process of translation work is not explicitly recognized in authorship criteria guidelines, whereas the work of putting cohesive English words to paper is a key marker of authorship contribution. Ethiopians may have less experience and formal training in academic writing, along with less institutional academic support. Even as we write this commentary in English, we are aware of how our shared voice may not fully reflect the ideas and intentions of those of us who think more fluently in the Amharic language.",

We find ourselves repeatedly tripping over these artefacts as we work to mitigate power imbalances. Naidu further argues that any scholarly conversation that aims to globalize health professions education in an authentic way must in and of itself be scrutinized for colonized ways of thinking.

In addition to practices already in place, we suggest that given that the universal language of publishing is English, perhaps journal editorial teams might examine their assumptions about words and phrases that are considered legitimate. Should our lexicon only include words and phrases that are familiar to North American and European audiences? In various international collaborations and as reviewers and editors, we have noted differences in terminology even between North American and European settings and have sometimes struggled with what range of terminology is appropriate. While journals obviously aspire to use language that allows ease of reading, perhaps there needs to be an expanded notion of who is considered as the readership.

Naidu (2020) convincingly argues that current assumptions of what constitutes and what counts in global medical education has a distinctly 'Northern tilt' which can hide or appropriate Southern ways of knowing. The adoption of Euroamerican practices and products has historically provided a means by which authors from other countries have been able to join global conversations. For example, despite being a difficult fit within Asian cultures, many medical schools adopted problem-based learning as a solution to entering the twenty-first Century globalized knowledge-based economy (Gwee 2008) . While this is an important step towards inclusivity, perhaps focussing only on how Euroamerican tools and practices can be adopted or adapted in other contexts is insufficient. Of course everyone can and should have the agency to look at models from afar and adapt as useful in their contexts.

The publishing landscape might look very different if Euroamerican authors were expected to demonstrate the relevance of their research for a truly global audience, rather than only for privileged portions of the international community. If journals are open to re-considering current conceptions of local versus interternational relevance, we suggest that a key step would be for journal editorial teams (which often have a preponderance of HIC country members) to engage in dialogue with LMIC academics. Such dialogue might include consideration of whether there are additional ways to recognize rigour using theories and methodologies that are not based in Euroamerican understandings. This might help journal editorial teams re-imagine appropriate ways to value and incorporate local knowledges from non-Euroamerican contexts. In the first 25 years of the journal, AHSE has pushed the field to include diverse Euroamerican theoretical and methodological approaches, giving voice to a significant cross-section of scholarly disciplines.",
