            "text": "Antibiotic stewardship is critical for tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR), especially in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 1 In a recent systematic review on antibiotic prescription practices in primary care settings across low-income and middleincome countries (LMICs), we showed that approximately 50% of patients of any age seeking care for any reason received at least one antibiotic. 2 However, determining inappropriate prescription in LMICs is a challenge, and a standardised tool for its assessment is currently unavailable. Inappropriate antibiotic prescribing can derive from a range of failings: (1) prescription in the absence of clinical indication (ie, 'overprescription'), which not only produces zero benefit to the patient but can also be harmful (eg, drug toxicities or costs for patients); (2) failure to prescribe antibiotics when necessary (ie, 'underprescription'); (3) suboptimal antibiotic choice with respect to aetiology (confirmed or presumptive), site, severity of infection and patient characteristics (eg, age, comorbidities and pregnancy status); (4) prescription of wrong dosage and/or duration of antibiotic treatment as compared with national and international guidelines. 3 4 Methods used to assess inappropriateness, such as prescription audits, medical records and patient exit interviews, have multiple limitations. 3 5 Electronic records are seldom available in LMICs, particularly in primary care, thus making accurate prescription audit tools difficult to implement. Also, the paucity and variation of clinical details that can be captured through medical records (paperbased or not), if they even exist, makes it even harder to determine the appropriateness BMJ Global Health of prescription. 3 Patient exit interviews are commonly used alternatives but come with several major drawbacks that can result in poor and inaccurate estimates that are incomparable. Data collected in this manner are subject to recall bias, poor recall and limited clinical expertise among patients. Further, not only are clinical presentations highly heterogeneous but also the difficulty in actually determining what patients have makes comparisons very challenging for research.",

The SP approach is not affected by poor recall, recall bias or the Hawthorne effect, which is commonly observed in patient exit interviews and direct observations of patient-provider encounters. 5 Considering the aforementioned advantages, we performed a secondary analysis of prescription data from previously conducted SP studies in three LMICs (India, China and Kenya) with two objectives: (1) to estimate the overall proportion of SP-provider interactions (separately for pharmacy-based and health facility-based studies) that resulted in prescription or dispensing of at least one antibiotic in the absence of clinical indication (ie, overprescription) and (2) to identify factors associated with antibiotic overprescribing in health facilities.",

[6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] The methods used are described in our published manual and toolkit on how to conduct SP studies. 5 Among studies carried out in India, four involved primary health facilities across five sites (Delhi, Mumbai, Patna, three districts in the State of Madhya Pradesh, and Birbhum district in the State of West Bengal), [6] [7] [8] [9] while two were performed in pharmacies located in four different areas (Mumbai, Patna, Delhi and Udupi district of Karnataka). 10 11 We also examined data from a pilot study carried out in Nairobi (Kenya) and two studies completed in rural areas of China (Shaanxi, Sichuan and Anhui provinces), all involving only primary healthcare providers.

For all prevalence proportions, we computed 95% CIs using bootstrapping in order to account for clustering at the study level. 18 In order to examine the factors associated with antibiotic prescribing in health facilities in India, we fit a hierarchical Poisson regression model that allows direct estimation of adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) even if the outcome is common as in this case. Our model included a random intercept for studies and dummy variables for facility location, healthcare sector, provider qualification and tracer conditions as predictors. 19 As we anticipated a fair amount of between-study heterogeneity, we decided to opt for a mixed model that could better account for it as compared with including the study or study site as a covariate. Among tracer conditions, only angina, asthma and presumptive TB could be included in order to avoid sparse data problems (ie, violations of the positivity assumption). The effect of all predictors was expected to be similar across studies, and therefore only fixed slopes were considered. These analyses were restricted to India because we had diverse and more data.

Pooled data from two studies conducted in China showed lower levels of antibiotic overuse (28.8%), but it should be noted that percentages differed substantially across individual studies, likely reflecting the different type of cases being involved. In fact, SP-provider interactions involving presumptive TB cases were more likely to result in antibiotic prescription as compared with other clinical conditions. Among the two pharmacy-based SP studies done in India, 10 11 the proportion of antibiotic dispensing was 26.6% and 3.6%, respectively.",

Although previous research had already highlighted that Watch group antibiotics are highly prescribed across India and China, such studies could not provide a clear picture of inappropriate antibiotic use owing to the limited amount of clinical information available from prescription audits and evaluations of drug sales data. [32] [33] [34] Among the main advantages of using SPs to evaluate prescription practices is the fact that tracer conditions are standardised. 5 In all studies included in our analyses, such conditions were very common illnesses that are frequently encountered in primary care and that require a well-defined diagnostic and therapeutic management that does not involve antibiotic use.",

Yet, this distribution well reflects the fact that about 75% of outpatient visits in India take place in the private sector, with nearly 70% of primary care in the country being delivered by informal providers. 35 36 Of note, available data originated from a range of geographical areas with different sociocultural and economic profiles and could be generalisable to similar contexts in India.

Third, we could not investigate other important forms of inappropriate antibiotic use, such as the choice of the incorrect drug and dosage to treat a given infection. This is an intrinsic limitation that arises from the type of tracer conditions used across SP studies so far. Although the SP methodology was initially implemented to assess overall quality of care in LMICs and to evaluate educational/ behavioural programmes in high-income countries, this approach is being increasingly adopted to gain insight into medication use, and especially drug dispensing practices among pharmacists. Data recording systems in SP studies are therefore improving in order to facilitate the collection of key details regarding medications that were harder to capture from studies whose main objective was not related to drug use.",

SPs represent a unique opportunity to further explore prescription practices among healthcare providers, including the management of common infectious diseases, such as pneumonia or urinary tract infections, that contribute substantially to the overall antibiotic use in primary care.
