            "text": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major polyphenol in green tea, exhibits diverse biological activities. Previous studies show that EGCG could effectively suppress HBV gene expression and replication, but the role of EGCG in HBV replication and its underlying mechanisms, especially the signaling pathways involved, remain unclear. In this study we investigated the mechanisms underlying EGCG inhibition on HBV replication with a focus on the signaling pathways. We showed that EGCG (12.5\u221250 \u03bcM) dose-dependently inhibited HBV gene expression and replication in HepG2.2.15 cells. Similar results were observed in HBV mice receiving EGCG (25 mg\u00b7 kg \u22121 \u00b7 d \u22121 , ip) for 5 days. In HepG2.2.15 cells, we showed that EGCG (12.5\u221250 \u03bcM) significantly activate ERK1/2 MAPK signaling, slightly activate p38 MAPK and JAK2/STAT3 signaling, while had no significant effect on the activation of JNK MAPK, PI3K/ AKT/mTOR and NF-\u03baB signaling. By using specific inhibitors of these signaling pathways, we demonstrated that ERK1/2 signaling pathway, but not other signaling pathways, was involved in EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV transcription and replication. Furthermore, we showed that EGCG treatment dose-dependently decreased the expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1) both at the mRNA and protein levels, which could be reversed by pretreatment with the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (20 \u03bcM). Moreover, we revealed that EGCG treatment dose-dependently inhibited the activity of HBV core promoter and the following HBV replication. In summary, our results demonstrate that EGCG inhibits HBV gene expression and replication, which involves ERK1/2mediated downregulation of HNF4\u03b1.These data reveal a novel mechanism for EGCG to inhibit HBV gene expression and replication.",

The reason for HBV tropism is largely unknown. Although it is assumed that infection is limited to the liver because of the tissue-restricted expression of the viral receptor [21, 22] , liver-enriched transcription factors, especially hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 (HNF4\u03b1), are found to contribute to the hepatocyte-specific tropism of HBV [23] . Accumulating evidence indicates that the regulation of the expression of HNF4\u03b1 may play an important role in determining HBV transcription and replication [24, 25] . For example, the activation of signaling pathways, such as MAPKs, has been reported to affect the expression level of HNF4\u03b1 and contribute to the regulation of HBV replication [26] .",

We therefore paid particular attention to the possible role of signaling pathways in EGCG inhibition of HBV in the present investigation. We treated HepG2.2.15 cells with increasing amounts of EGCG for 24 h and then detected the activation of various signaling pathways by Western blotting. The results in the cell lysates was determined by Western blotting; the levels of HBV pgRNA and HBV RNAs (d) were determined by qRT-PCR; the levels of intracellular core particle-associated HBV-DNA (e, f) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Southern blotting, respectively; and the cell viability (g) was determined by CCK8 assay. The values are expressed as the means \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments showed that EGCG treatment significantly upregulated the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), slightly upregulated the levels of p-p38, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3, and had little effect on the levels of p-JNK, p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-p70S6K, p-I\u03baB\u03b1, and p-NF-\u03baB-p65 (Fig. 3a) , indicating that EGCG treatment could significantly activate ERK1/2 MAPK signaling and slightly activate p38 MAPK and JAK2/STAT3 signaling, but had no significant effect on the activation of JNK MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and NF-\u03baB signaling. To investigate the role of ERK MAPK, p38 MAPK and JAK2/ STAT3 signaling in the EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV, HepG2.2.15 cells were pretreated with ERK inhibitor (PD98059), p38 inhibitor (SB203580) or JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor (AG490) for 1 h, followed by treatment with 25 \u03bcM EGCG for another 24 h. Our data showed that PD98059, SB203580, or AG490 could efficiently inhibit the activation of their corresponding signaling pathways (Fig. 3b) ; however, the inhibition of ERK1/2, but not other signaling pathways, significantly attenuated the EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV gene expression and replication (Fig. 3c) .",

Our data showed that EGCG treatment significantly suppressed the activity of HBV core and preS promoters but had no significant effect on the activity of S and X promoters (Fig. 5a-d) .

We further investigated the role of the ERK1/2-HNF4\u03b1 axis in EGCGmediated inhibition of the HBV core promoter. Our data showed that the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, but not the p38 inhibitor SB203580 or the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor AG490, significantly attenuated EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV core promoter activity (Fig. 6a) , correlated with their effect on HBeAg and HBV-DNA as shown in Fig. 3c .

Furthermore, we determined the effect of HNF4\u03b1 on the EGCGmediated inhibition of HBV gene expression and replication. As shown in Fig. 6c , the ectopic expression of HNF4\u03b1 also significantly reversed the suppressive effect of EGCG on HBeAg and HBV-DNA levels.

The reports indicate that EGCG plays an important role in the regulation of diverse signaling pathways. For example, PKC\u03b1 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways are involved in EGCG-mediated protection against restraint stress-induced neural injuries in rats [32] , and EGCG could attenuate high-fat-and highfructose-induced cognitive defects by regulating the IRS/AKT and ERK/CREB/BDNF signaling pathways [33] . The activation of several signaling pathways, such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling, has been suggested to play important roles in the regulation of HBV replication [35, 37] . Our previous investigation demonstrated that ROS-JNK signaling was involved in HBV/HBx-induced autophagosome formation and thus contributed to the regulation of HBV replication [28] . In mechanistic studies, we focused on the role of signaling pathways in the EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV. Our data showed that EGCG treatment could activate the ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathways but had little effect on other signaling pathways, such as JNK MAPK, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and NF-\u03baB signaling. However, further studies revealed that the activation of ERK1/2, but not p38 or JAK2/STAT3 signaling, played an important role in the suppression of HBV gene expression and replication by EGCG.",

We therefore also investigated the effect of EGCG on the activity of all four HBV promoters: core, S, preS and X promoters. EGCG treatment displayed a strong inhibitory effect on the HBV core promoter, while its effect on the HBV surface promoter was much less significant, which was correlated with the data showing that EGCG had a stronger (1) LUC (c) or XpLUC (d), respectively. Twenty-four hours post transfection, the cells were further treated with increasing doses of EGCG (25 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M) for another 24 h. The luciferase activity in cell lysates was then determined. The luciferase activity of EGCGuntreated cells was set to 100%. In all transfection assays, pCMV-\u03b2gal was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. The values are expressed as the means \u00b1 SEM of three independent experiments inhibitory effect on the level of HBeAg and HBV-DNA than that of HBsAg. Furthermore, our data revealed that the inhibition of ERK1/ 2 activity or HNF4\u03b1 overexpression significantly reversed the EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV core promoter activity and the subsequent HBV replication, indicating that the ERK1/2-HNF4\u03b1 axis contributed to the EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV gene expression and replication. Similar to our data, Zhao et al. [26] reported that an antimicrobial peptide, Mucroporin-M1, also suppressed HBV replication by activating ERK1/2 signaling and downregulating HNF4\u03b1. Together, these data suggest that targeting the ERK1/2-HNF4 axis may be helpful for controlling HBV infection.",

Further study showed that EGCG-activated ERK1/2 signaling might lead to the downregulation of HNF4\u03b1, a key player in HBV gene expression and replication, and the ERK1/2-HNF4\u03b1 axis was revealed to contribute to the EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV.

The cells were transfected with a core promoter-dependent reporter plasmid (CpLUC). Twenty-four hours post transfection, the cells were treated with EGCG in the absence or presence of the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (20 \u03bcM), the p38 inhibitor 203580 (10 \u03bcM) or the JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor AG490 (50 \u03bcM) for 24 h, followed by the detection of luciferase activity in the cell lysates. b The effect of ectopic HNF4\u03b1 expression on the EGCG-mediated inhibition of HBV promoter activity. The HNF4\u03b1 expression plasmid (pHNF4\u03b1-HA) was transfected into HepG2.2.15 cells together with CpLUC.
