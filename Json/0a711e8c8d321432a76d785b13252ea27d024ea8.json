Importantly, this microvasculitis was associated with characteristic findings on hematoxylin and eosin examination that included endothelial degeneration and resultant basement membrane zone disruption and reduplication. It is concluded that serious COVID-19 infection has two distinct mechanisms: 1) a microangiopathy of pulmonary capillaries associated with a high infectious viral load where endothelial cell death releases pseudovirions into the circulation, and 2) the pseudovirions dock on ACE2+ endothelial cells most prevalent in the skin/subcutaneous fat and brain that activates the complement pathway/coagulation cascade resulting in a systemic procoagulant state as well as the expression of cytokines that produce the cytokine storm. The data predicts a favorable response to therapies based on either removal of circulating viral proteins and/or blunting of the endothelial-induced response.",

ACE2 destruction brings about enhanced endothelial NADPH2 oxidase activity, increasing necrotic cell death and decreased endothelial nitric oxidase activity promoting vasoconstriction (53,54).",

The high levels of IL6, as well TNF \uf061, p38, IL8 and IL1\uf020\uf062 contribute further to the thrombotic diathesis by virtue of its positive effects on inducing platelet aggregation (47). Indeed, exposure to serum from severe Covid-19 patients can induce control platelet aggregation, pointing to a critical role in circulating factors in platelet aggregation and thrombosis (58).",

The C5b-9 was deposited in capillary walls, endothelia and intravascular macrophages; the pattern of immunoreactivity included an intracellular one within the endothelium and a surface punctate granular one that outlined the abluminal surface of the vessels. Intravascular platelets also contained C4d and at times other components of complement. In lung samples showing advanced injury with end stage fibrosis there was no vascular complement deposition.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA/protein (infectious virus) in high copy number is evident only in the septal capillaries/macrophages in the lung whereas pseudovirions (spike, envelope, membrane proteins without viral RNA) are evident systemically where they are endocytosed by ACE2+ endothelia, which dominate in the skin, brain, and liver. 3) Host response. Complement activation is evident with both the infectious virus and pseudovirions. However, cytokine up regulation including IL6, IL8, IL1 \uf062, TNF a, and p38 as well as caspase 3 expression is evident only with the pseudovirions where they strongly co-express with the viral capsid proteins. In the brain, the microvasculitis is mainly confined to the endothelial cells with mminimal evidence of neuronal or other cell death. A graphic summary of these mechanisms is provided in Figure 8 .",

            "text": "In an earlier study we showed that a critical aspect of the pathophysiology of severe COVID-19 is one of complement mediated vascular injury in the lung (9) . In the 5 cases presented in the original study, the lung and skin of all patients had evidence of vascular injury characterized by endothelial necrosis and thrombosis associated with microvascular deposition of complement including C4d, MASP2, and C5b-9 indicative of mannan binding lectin (MBL) pathway activation (9) . By demonstrating that endothelial based SARS CoV-2 viral capsid proteins co-expressed with these complement proteins, it was assumed that infectious virus was inducing the MBL pathway. This prior study did not specifically address whether or not the viral Given the millions of cases worldwide, the clinical correlates of severe COVID-19 are well documented. These include an independent association with obesity, strong correlation with preexisting conditions including diabetes, a hypercoagulable state, so-called cytokine storm and neurologic signs/symptoms that often become manifest 1-2 weeks after pneumonia (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . The current study by correlating the light microscopic, viral, and host response, including cytokine expression and complement analysis of significantly ill COVID-19 patients, has provided data that may help to understand the foundation for these clinical correlates. The extremely high copy viral load in the lung induces a microangiopathy that destroys the infected endothelial cell and, thus, could release large numbers of pseudovirions into the circulation. The spike protein in these pseudovirions will dock on ACE2+ endothelia. The largest reservoir for the latter is the subcutaneous fat, which will be much increased in the obese. The endocytosed viral proteins induce a strong complement cascade activation and marked cytokine response including IL6, IL8, IL1 \uf062 , p38, and TNF \uf061. These cellular responses would cause many systemic medical problems, especially in those with pre-existing medical conditions. The observation that the microvascular bed in the liver and brain also contains many ACE2+ endothelial cells that, as demonstrated here, shows much evidence of viral-induced damage, could clearly be related to dermal and subcutaneous vasculature were observed in the autopsy cases in grossly normal skin.",

These studies have found active replicating virus in the blood, brain, brain, spleen, placenta, liver, large and small intestine, skeletal muscle, and lymph nodes (20) (21) (22) . To our knowledge, replicating virus has not been detected in skin samples (23-25). What has been reported as viral inclusions have been found in the kidney endothelium, and apoptotic blebbing with microvesicles has been seen in the endothelium of other organ systems as well; active replication was not proven (26, 27). Viruslike particles have also been seen in the endothelium in the brain with concomitant detection of viral RNA from minced FFPE tissue, though localization to the endothelium could not documented (20) . Given the widespread expression of ACE-2 receptors across many tissue types, it is possible that the aforementioned studies detected viral replication in non-vascular tissue (28); this study did document rare macrophages in the heart/liver/kidney that contained infectious virus that could produce a positive result with RTPCR. It is postulated that the corporeally. In the setting of MERS there was reduced infectivity and reduced concentrations of circulating viral particles over time with apheresis.
