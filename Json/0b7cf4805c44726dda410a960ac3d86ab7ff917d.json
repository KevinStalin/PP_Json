During a median follow-up of 25 days, 33 ( Despite these advances in the understanding of COVID-19 and cancer, the frequency of hospital-acquired infection in this population at high-risk for severe disease remains unknown. Data from Wuhan demonstrated a 7.1% rate of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 among 918 patients with COVID-19 10 , while a study from the UK found a rate of 20% 11 . These alarming rates occurred in the absence of optimized J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f targeted infection control and prevention (ICP) measures 12 . Due to these reports, as well as the high level of contact that patients with cancer have with the healthcare system (e.g. frequent blood tests, treatments, and hospitalizations for treatment-related complications), cancer centers rapidly enforced ICP measures in order to limit exposure of these patients to COVID-19. There is therefore an urgent need to describe the impact of hospital-acquired COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer in order to reinforce stringent infection control strategies to protect this vulnerable population. The goal of the present study was to characterize the incidence of hospital-acquired transmission in Canadian cancer centres across two provinces, and further define predictive factors for COVID-19 severity in the cancer patient population.",

ECOG; Eastern cooperative oncology group performance status. study of 252 patients with COVID-19 and cancer across the provinces of Quebec and British Columbia in Canada, we found a high mortality at 28% among adult patients, while none of the patients in the pediatric cohort experienced severe disease.Reflective of the higher incidence of COVID-19 in Quebec, the majority of patients in this cohort resided in the province of Quebec compared to British Colombia. Moreover, the vast majority of patients in our cohort were adults, reflecting the rarity of overt COVID-19 infections in the pediatric population. Most commonly affected cancers in this cohort were lung cancer and breast cancer, which aligns with previous publications describing cancer type in relation to COVID-19 6 . We found a high rate of hospitalacquired COVID-19 and this was associated with high mortality both in univariate and multivariate analyses.Our study reinforces the importance of strategizing and further study of ICP in order to prevent transmission of COVID-19 to hospitalized patients 14, 15 . For example, screening staff members and patients either for symptoms of COVID-19 or COVID-19 infection prior to entry in COVID-free units could be a potential method16 , as is suggested by several guidelines17 . Designating COVID-free units and personnel including pharmacists, physicians, nurses and other house-staff also recommended by healthcare authorities 18 . Adequate personal protective equipment 19 and strict handhygiene protocols 20 are also of utmost importance for decreasing nosocomial infection.",

Median overall survival was shorter in those with hospital-acquired infection, compared to a contemporary community-acquired population (27 days vs unreached, HR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.4, p=0.0006). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that hospital-acquired COVID-19, age, ECOG status, and advanced stage of cancer were independently associated with death.Interpretation: Our study demonstrates a high rate of nosocomial transmission of COVID-19, associated with increased mortality in both univariate and multivariate analysis in the cancer population, reinforcing the importance of treating patients with J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f In December 2019, a cluster of pneumonias caused by a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was reported in Wuhan, China 1 . As of July 15th, 2020, more than 13,382,020 million cases of COVID-19 have been declared worldwide, with more than 579,546 deaths (case-fatality rate globally of ~4%) 1,2 . Risk factors for severe disease include older age and underlying comorbidities, such as obesity and diabetes 3,4 . Patients with cancer are at particularly increased risk for severe COVID-19 4-6 . Indeed, Liang et al. first described a nation-wide analysis in China of COVID-19 in patients with cancer 5 . In this study of 1590 patients, however, only 18 patients (1.1%) had a diagnosis of cancer. Compared to patients without cancer, these patients were more likely to experience severe COVID-19. In another retrospective analysis, Yu et al. identified COVID-19 in 0.79% of their patients with cancer (12 of 1524 patients), which was higher than the cumulative incidence of all diagnosed COVID-19 cases that was reported in the city of Wuhan over the same time period (0.37%; 41 152 of 11 081 000 cases) 7 . Next, a report from Italy demonstrated that among 355 patients hospitalized for COVID-19, 20.3% of patients had active cancer 8 . In order to address the severity of COVID-19 among patients with cancer, Dai et al. studied the outcomes of 105 patients with cancer with COVID-19 compared to 536 matched controls with COVID-19. Patientswith cancer had higher risks in all severe outcomes, and patients with hematological malignancy, lung cancer, or with stage IV cancer were more likely to experience severe events9 . More recent reports in a large cohort of 928 patients from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) identified that age, smoking status, male sex, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and presence of comorbidities were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19 6 .",
