The aim of the present paper is to show that identification of individual virus particles in clinical sample materials quickly and reliably is near at hand. First of all, our team has developed techniques for identification of virions based on a modular atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, femtosecond adaptive spectroscopic techniques with enhanced resolution via coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (FASTER CARS) using tip-enhanced techniques markedly improves the sensitivity [M.

The scientific goal is, in addition to virus diagnostics, to identify structural changes of the virus surface at an early stage, using so-called tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) together with coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) (Fig. 1 ). This combined technique will improve the sensitivity and consequently speed up acquisition times considerably. In contrast to known methods, this is unique. Due to its surface specificity our technique allows early detection of changes that alter the antigenic properties of viruses and thus the effectiveness of vaccines, with the smallest sample quantities. Furthermore, identification without specific antibodies is possible. This goes far beyond the current state of the art.",

Viruses can multiply only within a suitable host cell and as the infection propagates, the virion attacks a cell of a living organism by injecting it with genetic material and inducing the cell to make multiple replicas of the virion. The building blocks of a virion are either DNA or RNA molecules surrounded by a protective scaffold of proteins, the so-called (nucleo)capsid (e.g., coxsasckievirus B3 [CVB3] virus in Fig. 1) . Moreover, there can be a lipid bilayer serving as an envelope. Protein spikes can protrude from the bilayer, forming a sea urchin-like structure (e.g., H1N1 virus in Fig. 1 ).",

            "text": "Some viruses are pathogenic and can cause severe diseases, which makes accurate diagnostics essential. The goal is to characterize the specific virus based on single viral particles. One common technique is the PCR, which has simplified and accelerated the detection of pathogens over culturing techniques (2) (3) (4) . In PCR, the nucleic acid-either DNA or RNA-has to be extracted from the specimen first. Next, characteristic viral sequences are amplified employing varying primer sets followed by further molecular analysis (2, 3) . In general, multiple DNA target molecules are necessary for sufficient amplification and the examination of a single virus particle is still challenging. Although PCR technologies are quite powerful, several drawbacks limit the application in microbiological diagnostics. On the one hand, high sensitivity of DNA/RNA amplification makes this process susceptible to contamination that might yield falsepositive results. Furthermore, false-negative results, e.g., due to failed amplification, have to be considered, too (4) . The nature of the PCR process is prone to several disturbing factors that may hamper exponential DNA amplification. The implementation of the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in recent Significance Surface features of a virus are very important in determining its virility. For example, the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to the ACE2 receptor site of the host cell with a much stronger affinity than did the original SARS virus. Thus, it is clearly important to understand the virion surface structure. To that end, the present paper combines the spatial resolution of atomic force microscopy and the spectral resolution of coherent Raman spectroscopy. This combination of tip-enhanced microscopy using femtosecond adaptive spectroscopic techniques for coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (FAST CARS) with enhanced resolution (FASTER CARS) allows us to map a single virus particle with nanometer resolution and chemical specificity. years, where fluorescent molecules are added, enables exact quantitation of template DNA (3, 5, 6) .",

The same setup also provides topographic imaging of the sample surface in a single experiment. The spatial resolution in TERS is limited by the diameter of the silver particle at the tip and lately has been pushed down to around 0.5 to 1 nm for biosamples (9, 16, 17) .

Depending on the number of acquired data, subsequent multivariate data analysis might be useful for data assessment. In the context of a general tip-enhanced approach of a virus identification, it is important to point out that not only all major components to be expected in viruses [namely DNA/RNA (19) (20) (21) , proteins, lipids, and even glycoproteins] have been already detected by TERS. Also, different studies on viruses (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) already proved the feasibility of the concept. In contrast to PCR-related techniques, in TERS a separation of the different components or labeling is not required, and ultimately only a single virion is sufficient for an identification.",

            "text": "For the present experiments an enveloped influenza A virus H1N1 and a nonenveloped CVB3 were chosen. (To apply the present technique to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virion, the experiment must be carried out in a biosafe environment and such studies will be reported elsewhere.) The swine H1N1 influenza virus particle is composed of a 2-to 6-nm lipid bilayer decorated with viral proteins and eight ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. The RNPs consist of RNA strands, which interact with numerous nucleoprotein molecules and some viral polymerase complexes. The consistency of the lipid envelope depends on the type of cell membrane of host cell the virus originates. The inner surface is covered completely with viral matrix protein. From the lipid layer flexible pro-tein spikes with a protrusion height of 10 to 14 nm stick out (27) . In Fig. 1 the structure of an influenza virus is sketched. From AFM measurements it is known that H1N1 shows pleomorphism that means size (150 to 400 nm) and shape (spherical or rodlike) vary (27, 28) . The dimension of the CVB3 virus ( Fig. 1) is 10 times smaller (20 to 30 nm), with an icosahedral structure (determined by crystallography), where the RNA is packed in a protein coat (capsid) (29) . Clearly, the different surface components of the viruses yield TERS spectra with information on proteins and lipids for H1N1 (Fig. 1B) and protein and RNA for CVB3 (Fig. 1C) . Again, it is obvious that spectral variability on the virus surface occurs and a larger virus surface area must be considered. Nevertheless, a discrimination of both viruses solely based on the TERS spectra is quite straightforward. The experiment with the full statistical evaluation (multiple maps, different particles, different tips) will be published elsewhere. Here we want to emphasize that the method is potentially able to identify any single virus based on the surface composition. The main challenge is the time required for an assessment, particularly the spectral acquisition time. Interestingly, the necessary AFM topography which is always detected to locate a sample can also provide substantial information for a virus prescreening, thus considerably limiting the potential candidates for TERS investigations (30) .",

If a mere virus classification rather than nanometerscale structural information is the goal, a different experimental approach could be advantageous, particularly by decreasing the overall acquisition time considerably. The approach shown here artificially decreases the spatial resolution by deliberately scanning the tip during the acquisition. This way, the spectral information is based on the entire scanned surface and as the tip is scanned continuously rather than in a step-scan manner, this also ensures a \"gap-free\" TERS experiment. It is important to note that this approach is fundamentally different from a conventional SERS experiment, where one would bring the plasmonic substrate in contact with a virus sample. In such an experiment no averaging can be achieved on a single virus and consequently a large number of samples must be investigated. Furthermore, specific substrate-sample interactions will lead to preferential binding sites that will also strongly affect the results.",

            "text": "In Fig. 2 we present two straightforward TERS experiments, acquired while scanning a defined area on a single H1N1 and CVB3 virus, respectively. This way, all Raman signals during the scan were detected while the lateral resolution was intentionally decreased. The measurement parameters were adjusted such that exactly one spectrum was recorded during one topography scan. In both samples the respective spectra acquired during subsequent topography scans indicate that the apparent spectral reproducibility is much higher compared to the single acquisitions in Fig. 1 , thus demonstrating the expected location averaging. This leads to a much faster overall data acquisition and much more representative spectral data. This comes at a cost that some information is consequently buried in an averaged dataset; i.e., the clearly visible lipid marker bands of the H1N1 virus of the \"high-resolution\" data acquisition are not evident in Fig. 2 , hence indicating that lipids patches that are accessible for the TERS tip are comparatively rare. While it is theoretically possible to achieve the same result by combining all high-resolution spectra of a sample, e.g., combining all spectra from a virus scan in Fig. 1 B and C, for a comparison it must be warranted that the specimen is sampled correctly; otherwise an imbalance of certain chemical distributions will affect the resulting postexperimental averaged data. This is particularly important since recent experimental and theoretical high-resolution TERS studies indicate a resolution down to the\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m regime. For a TERS experiment this leads to very small step sizes, i.e., to a prohibitively long acquisition time. For an analytical/diagnostic application the average data are most likely much more useful as they can be accessed much faster and due to the intrinsic spectral averaging provide a typical fingerprint of the virus. It is of course still important to determine the minimum representative scan area for a virus, which allows the clear identification of the virus strand. This is essential for comparison with other experiments, e.g., to avoid geometrical influences of the tip.",

Specifically, we have developed additional vibrational spectroscopic techniques for nanoscale real-time molecular sensing having large signal enhancement, small background, short detection time, and high spectral resolution (34, 35) . On the other hand, other groups have pushed the surface-enhanced CARS to single-molecule sensitivity (36, 37) .
