In analyses of thromboembolic and bleeding events, the date of that event also led to censoring of follow-up time. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate the cumulative risk of death, thromboembolic event, and bleeding event, and the log-rank test was used to compare the initial dosing strategies.

BMI was flexibly adjusted with restricted cubic splines while missing values were accounted for using chained iterations of multiple imputed data sets (n=20) (23). Although no formal evidence, there was an indication of violation of the assumption of proportional hazards when scaled Schoenfeld residuals were regressed against survival time (P=0.06 for high dose thromboprophylaxis). Thus, the time-varying effect was fitted by splitting the follow-up time at 7 days from ICU-admission, and fitting the time varying covariate as an interaction-term with the main exposure.

The HR of death was 0.33 (95% CI 0.13 -0.87) among those who received high dose, respectively 0.88 (95% CI, 0.43 -1.83) among those who received medium dose, as compared with those who received low dose thromboprophylaxis, ( Table 3 ). The cumulative proportion of deaths within the first 28-days from ICU-admission differed between the three groups (P log-rank=0.02). The risk of death did not differ between groups of exposure until 7 days after admission, after which the proportion of deaths increased in the low dose thromboprophylaxis group compared to the other groups ( Figure 2A ). When follow-up time was split and the time-varying covariate was fitted as an interaction term with the exposure (Table 4 ), the HR of high dose thromboprophylaxis was 0.08 (95% CI, 0.01 -0.62) day 7 to 28, compared with low dose thromboprophylaxis the same time period, while no differences were observed during day 0 to 7. The interaction term itself was not significant overall (P=0.18). Among the first half of admissions (before April 11, 2020), 74.7% (n=59) received low dose and 2.5% (n=2) high dose thromboprophylaxis. Corresponding proportions in the second half of admissions was 11.0% (n=8), respectively 48% (n=35).
