Over our full sample period of analysis , the results suggest a dominant role of interstate migration as an adjustment channel to labor demand shocks for the United States. In contrast, European countries tend to adjust to negative labor demand shocks mainly through changes in labor force participation and unemployment. Labor mobility is lower in the euro area, regardless of whether one is looking at cross-country migration or within-country mobility. Price flexibility is more important as a shock absorber to labor demand shocks in the EMU compared to the United States. We also document that risk-sharing mechanisms have been, on average, more effective in smoothing income fluctuations in the United States than in the EMU. The strength of these channels, however, has changed over time both for the EMU and in the United States. In particular, the results suggest that the pattern of regional adjustments to shocks in EMU and the United States is moving closer, partly because of strengthening of adjustment channels in the EMU and partly because of weakening of these channels in the United States.

Growing attention has been paid to countries of the European Monetary Union (EMU) given the constraints posed on their adjustment by the loss of monetary independence. As discussed in the classic contribution by Mundell (1961) , several mechanisms must be in place to mitigate the negative effects of an asymmetric shock in cases when currency depreciation is not an option, as in the case of a monetary union.",

In other words, the channels of adjustment in the EMU are changing over time in a direction that supports the monetary union. In particular, although the role of migration as shock absorber remains more limited in the EMU than in the United States, it has increased over time in the euro area while it has declined in the United States, as documented by Dao et al. (2017) . Similarly, the degree of risk-sharing has improved over time in EMU countries, but it has declined in the United States. In particular, the results based on the post-EMU period (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) (2011) (2012) (2013) (2014) (2015) (2016) (2017) suggest that the amount of shock not smoothed in the EMU11 is almost identical to that of the United States. Looking at each risk-sharing channel, it seems that the major factor contributing to the increase in risk-sharing in the EMU11 is factor income flows.",

            "text": "The standard Optimal Currency Area theory, based on the pioneering contribution of Mundell (1961) , stresses that there should be a high degree of homogeneity, in terms of business cycle synchronization, among the countries that want to establish a currency area. This is because the more synchronized the business cycles among the member countries, the lower the probability of asymmetric shocks, and thus the less painful the loss of independent monetary policy and of a flexible exchange rate for the member country. Moreover, in the case of a high degree of business cycle synchronization, it becomes more plausible to expect a single monetary authority to respond to aggregate shocks and to implement these interventions with greater ease. 4 The literature on business cycle synchronization in Europe (and how it compares to the United States) is vast. Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1993) find that demand and supply shocks are more correlated between states in the United States than in Europe, and that the US states adjust more quickly to economic fluctuations than European countries. Wynne and Koo (2000) also find that business cycles are more aligned in the United States than in the Eurozone (of 11 members). Other authors, such as Clark and Shin (1998) and Clark and Van Wincoop (2001) , focused on both within-country and cross-country synchronization. They find that average within-country cyclical output correlations are larger than cross-country correlations, for both the United States and European countries (and again that business cycles are more synchronized in the United States than in Europe). Angeloni and Dedola (1998) find that the output correlation between Germany and other European countries has clearly increased during -1997 . Furceri and Karras (2006 , analyzing cyclical output for the EU-15 countries find that business-cycle synchronization has also increased for many countries from 1980 -1991 to 1992 -2003 . In contrast, Giannone et al. (2010 find that EMU has not affected historical characteristics of member countries' business cycles and their crosscorrelations.",

A first channel of adjustment is through migration. People from depressed economies can move to lower unemployment regions, until the former regain competitiveness. Higher migration flows could help avoid a sharp rise in unemployment or a strong decrease in activity rates in the economy affected by the adverse shock. A second channel of adjustment is through changes in relative prices-that is, real exchange rates. When an economy is hit by a negative demand shock, a reduction in relative prices compared to other countries in the union would lead to a depreciation in the real exchange rate and a consequent boost in export and external demand. Finally, a third category of adjustment pertains to private (income flows and private saving) and public (net transfers and government saving) risk-sharing mechanisms. In the face of a negative shock, these mechanisms can allow a smoothing of consumption. For example, in the case of interregional transfers, the government may provide insurance by transferring resources from economies with stronger cyclical positions to countries or regions affected by a negative shock.",

In addition, the relative insufficient degree of prices and wages flexibility in Europe is suggested by recent studies, such as Arpaia and Pichelmann (2007) and Heinz and Rusinova (2011) . Arpaia and Pichelmann (2007) suggest that long-lasting cross-country differences in labor cost and wage dynamics in the euro area reflect weak wage flexibility, rather than a mechanism of adjustment between countries. Heinz and Rusinova (2011) find that the degree of real wage flexibility tends to be larger in the central and eastern European countries than in the euro area-probably due to the more limited role played by trade unions and collective bargaining coverage in the EU peripheral economies. Indeed, Biroli et al. (2013) point to labor (and product) market regulations as natural candidates for explaining the changing behavior of price dynamics in response to shocks.",

If anything, business cycles appear to be slightly more synchronized, on average, in the EMU than in the United States.

Dispersion in unemployment rates turns out to be at least twice as large (depending on the measure used) between EMU11 countries than between US states. The chart also reveals two important facts: (i) up to the Global Financial Crisis, dispersion in unemployment rates decreased in EMU, particularly since the mid-90s, while it has remained broadly stable in the United States; (ii) in the aftermath of the GFC, dispersion has sky-rocketed in EMU11 and it still remains significantly above pre-crisis level, while in the United States the GFC did not have a significant and persistent effect on unemployment rates dispersion.

The results for the overall EMU11 area are presented Figure 9 and show that the relatively weak response of regional migration to labor demand shocks in the EMU11 is evident not only for international migration but also for intranational migration. However, these averages mask significant differences across EMU11 countries.

In this section, we compare the different behavior of relative price flexibility between the United States and the EMU11 following the approach proposed by Obstfeld and Peri (1988) .

As such Figure 10 illustrates the long-run variation in real exchange rates, while Figure 11 short-run variations in real exchange rates around their trend. Looking at Figure 10 , we can observe that price variability is not significantly different between EMU11 and the United States. Interestingly, in both currency unions we can observe a decline in price dispersion up to the Global Financial Crisis, and a significant increase afterwards. In contrast, looking at changes in relative prices we can observe that, on average, real exchange flexibility has been larger in the United States than in the EMU11 (Figure 11 ).
