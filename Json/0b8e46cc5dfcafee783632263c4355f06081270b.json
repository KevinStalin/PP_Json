There are large disparities in the burden of Covid-19 with an apparent lower risk of poor outcomes in East Asians compared to populations in the West. A recent study suggested that Covid-19 leads to a severe extrahepatic vitamin K insufficiency, which could lead to impaired activation of extrahepatic proteins like endothelial anticoagulant protein S in the presence of normal hepatic procoagulant activity. This would be compatible with the enhanced thrombogenicity in severe Covid-19. The same study showed that vitamin K antagonists (VKA) that inhibit vitamin K recycling, had a greater impact on procoagulant activity than on the activation of extrahepatic vitamin K-dependent proteins during SARS-CoV-2 infections. A genetic polymorphism in the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex 1, VKORC1 -1639A, is particularly prevalent in East Asia and associates with low vitamin K recycling rates. Carriage of the allele may be regarded as bioequivalent to low-dose VKA use.",

In contrast to other vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors, a significant proportion of anticoagulant protein S is extrahepatically synthesized [5] . Protein S produced in endothelial cells seems to be an important inhibitor of local thrombosis formation [5] . Vitamin K1, representing the main source of vitamin K in for most people, is preferentially transported to the liver [4] . Evidence indicates that during times of mild vitamin K insufficiency hepatic factors coagulation factors are preferentially activated over extrahepatic ones [6, 7] . Vitamin K-dependent matrix Gla protein (MGP) is a critical inhibitor of soft tissue mineralization and elastic fiber degradation [8] . Unpublished data from our research group suggest that MGP synthesis is strongly enhanced in the lungs of patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, plausibly to protect the pulmonary extracellular matrix from inflammation-induced degradation. Accelerated vitamin K utilization in the lungs may readily deplete extrahepatic vitamin K stores and prevent endothelial protein S from being activated [4, 5] . Vitamin K1 consumed during Covid-19 hospitalization will preferentially be directed to the liver for activation of hepatic coagulation factors [4] . This suggests that activation of endothelial protein S in these patients will be more severely compromised than activation of hepatic procoagulant factors [4] , which is compatible with enhanced thrombogenicity in Covid-19 [9] .",

Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was remarkably low in Japanese regions where average natto intake is high [12] .

The rate of vitamin K recycling depends on a polymorphism in the promoter region of the vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) gene [13] . In East Asia, positive selection for an allele that is associated with low vitamin K recycling rates started around 4,500 years ago [14] . Allele frequency of this derived -1639A VKCORC1 allele is around 75-100% in East Asians, whereas it is below 10% in Africans and intermediate in Europeans [15] . The near complete selective sweep in East Asian populations is remarkable due to the recent and rapid occurrence, and strongly suggests a survival benefit rather than the loss of redundant function [14] . However, it is an enigma why a polymorphism associated with reduced vitamin K recycling would carry a significant survival benefit, given that even high-dose vitamin K intake is not associated with adverse side effects [16] . Based on our recent data demonstrating pronounced extrahepatic vitamin K insufficiency and normal hepatic vitamin K status in Covid-19 [2] , we suggest a hypothesis by which this allele might give a survival benefit in Covid-19 patients.",

While levels of inactive factor II were low in most Covid-19 patients, unsurprisingly, Covid-19 patients using VKA had strongly increased levels of inactive factor II. However, there was much less difference in activation of MGP between Covid-19 patients with and without VKAs, suggesting that Covid-19 had already induced complete extrahepatic vitamin K deficiency without any additional effect from VKAs [2] .

The VKORC1 -1639A allele is associated with low vitamin K recycling rates, which may be regarded as a natural equivalent of using low-dose VKA. Therefore, we hypothesize that VKORC1 -1639A 5 protects against thrombosis during SARS-CoV-2 infection and thereby from poor disease outcomes. If this is indeed the case, the high incidence of VKORC1 -1639A in East Asia may form an explanation for the lower Covid-19-related morbidity and mortality rates.",

Driving a gene to near fixation, as appears to be the case for the VKORC1 -1639A allele in East Asia, also requires some degree of sustained selection pressure [18] . Endemic diseases with a moderate or high mortality rate can rapidly drive such genetic selection in humans. Some of the most wellknown examples of this are the influences of the malaria parasites Plasmodium vivax on the frequency of the Duffy blood group FY*O allele [19] and Plasmodium falciparum on the frequency of the sickle-cell allele [20] in Sub-Saharan Africa. We speculate that the VKORC1 -1639A allele might have given a survival advantage to a previous infectious disease with a higher mortality rate than Covid-19.",

Unfortunately, no specimens have remained from victims to assess whether organs were affected by microvessel thrombosis, like those found in postmortem lung examinations of Covid-19 patients [21] . If black death was indeed accompanied by coagulopathic manifestations, then VKORC1 -1639A might have conferred a survival benefit. Considering the epidemic also emerged from East Asia and was probably endemic in those regions for extended periods of time before arriving in Europe, we speculate this could be the reason for the near fixation of the VKORC1 -1639A allele in East Asian 6 populations and intermediate prevalence in European populations. Black death probably did not pass the Sahara, which would be compatible with low carriage of VKORC1 -1639A in African populations [15] .",
