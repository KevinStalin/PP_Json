Additionally, two case studies were included which illustrate the use of both tele-consultation and telesupervision in low-resource low-and middle-income settings. Summary The paper concludes that tele-consultation and tele-supervision hold the promise to narrow the gap in quality mental health services in low-resource settings so often impacted by disaster and conflict. The authors recommend that telemental health training be developed that specifically enhances consultants' and supervisors' skills in tele-consultation and tele-supervision.",

Health care and mental health providers are being pushed to the limit to meet the demands of their respective populations. Understandably, caring for the medical needs of those suffering from the COVID-19 virus is a priority, but mental health needs are gaining attention in the popular press in addition to the medical and mental health press. \"The psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic must be recognized alongside the physical symptoms for all those affected...Psychological symptoms relating to COVID-19 have already been observed on a population level...\" [1] . Staffing shortages and lack of specialty training in mental health are a particular challenge in low-resource settings [2] . Thus, mental health consultation and supervision of primary care providers (doctors and nurses) and paraprofessional community health workers is critical. This is especially true in low-resource settings. In low-and middle-income countries, 75% of people do not get the mental health services they need [3] . (World Health Organization, mhGAP: mental health care in low resource settings) In this paper, we operationalize lowresource settings as low-and middle-income countries as defined by the World Bank, that is, those settings with a disproportionate burden of disease on the poorest individuals in the world's poorest countries [4] .",

This paper will focus on the use of telemedicine as a vehicle for consultation and supervision within the mental health specialty area, known as telemental health, telepsychiatry, and, generally, telehealth. Specifically, this paper reviews the use of teleconsultation and tele-supervision as a solution to the problem of providing quality mental health care to those in need, while helping to provide support to on-the-ground mental health care providers. We operationalize tele-consultation as an indirect service that a specialist, such as a psychiatrist, provides as either a one-time or series of consultations, or an opinion, to a primary care provider, who is in need of specialty expertise and problem-solving support on a difficult case [5] . Telesupervision is also an indirect service offered by a mental health specialist, but it involves providing guidance to more junior mental health workers or students in need of supervision and support [6] . For example, in many global lowresource settings, direct care is often provided by community health workers, who may, or may not, have either graduate or post-graduate training, perhaps without much mental health training; thus, a tele-supervisor may provide the worker with the mental health knowledge, skills, and support the worker needs. While we use both terms in this paper, we would like the reader to understand the difference in meaning. The term telemental health (TMH) will be used throughout this paper.",

            "text": "Currently, TMH allows consultants/supervisors to reach distant \"hot zones\" of the COVID-19 crisis with specialty and expert knowledge that might be lacking in a low-resource setting, or to provide direct TMH services when the frontline medical teams are in need of a reprieve [7] . Thus, TMH is a key component in meeting needs in low-resource settings and extending medical services of frontline providers. This allows expert specialty collaboration with frontline providers who may need expert collaboration and/or supervision. For example, hospitals are using technology and telemedicine to assess patients prior to their arrival at the hospital with what is termed \"forward triage,\" which involves health providers tele-screening patients prior to the patient's arrival at the hospital [7] . Another such innovative screening and diagnostic program was developed at the University of California, Davis Medical Center (UC Davis), which provides tele-consultation to primary care providers (PCPs) in the California agricultural belt [8\u2022] . The program trains PCPs to perform a Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (SCID); then, the recorded audio and video is uploaded to a secure server at UC Davis along with the completed SCID results, and reviewed for the purpose of consultation by UC Davis Staff Psychiatrists and Residents. The loop is then completed by providing feedback to the PCPs via tele-consultation regarding diagnosis and treatment recommendations. The entire program is asynchronous which makes consultation more accessible for those with low bandwidth in low-resource settings. This innovative teleconsultation program has proved very successful and can be used as a model for other low-resource settings. In addition to the current COVID-19 crisis, it is important to consider the utility of TMH within the context of other crises. Natural disasters and man-made disasters, including armed conflicts, have marked human existence from time immemorial. However, in recent times, the scale and scope of these events have increased markedly, further solidifying mental health as an issue of global importance. As stated by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank, the health and mental health consequences of disasters and forced displacement are great [9] [10] [11] . Thus, disasters are a major contributor to the more than 264 million people of all ages worldwide estimated to be suffering from depression, making it the leading cause of disability worldwide, and a major contributor to the overall global disease burden [12] . The United Nations reports that disasters, natural and man-made, have caused 70.8 million forcibly displaced persons, including 41.3 million internally displaced persons, 25.9 million refugees, and 3.5 million asylum seekers [13] . These numbers now exceed the number of displaced persons from World War II. Meanwhile, between 1994 and 2013, natural disasters have affected about 218 million people every year [14] . The presence of conflict situations is associated with an increase in mental health disorder prevalence explained by high levels of stress that can prompt psychosocial or psychiatric disorders that were previously nonexistent or dormant [9] . Thus, the rates of mental illness due to man-made and natural disasters have dramatically increased, which is compounded by the fact that the majority of refugees and displaced persons reside in low-resource settings [13] .",

            "text": "Most mental health providers working in low-resource settings are without adequate clinical supervision [15, 16] . Without supervision, mental health support may be of limited quality and exacerbate risks for on-the-ground mental health care providers (e.g., safety concerns, compassion fatigue). For example, Liberia, which has suffered armed conflict, natural disasters (e.g., episodes of extreme flooding), and medical catastrophes, including the Ebola epidemic, has a population of approximately 4.5 million persons, and less than 1% of the population has access to mental health care [17] . Additionally, Liberia has only two psychiatrists [16] . Thus, most of the mental health care is provided by primary care doctors and mental health care extenders, such as local social workers and community health care workers. Without supervision, such mental health extenders are without support in the field, and thus, their ability to make difficult decisions regarding differential diagnosis and treatments is limited, with consequences for the refugees served. However, as shown by a 7-year longitudinal study with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), implementation of TMH supervision has the potential to offer online expertise to the provider in a way that has both clinical value for patient care and educational benefits for providers [18\u2022] .",

Man-made disasters, such as armed conflict, are unique in that the survivors are typically aware that the perpetrators intentionally inflicted the trauma. Survivors of these man-made disasters have often endured unspeakable trauma to themselves and/or their loved ones. As such, the trauma tends to be more complex and, thus, the treatment needs to address the complex nature of the trauma. In a study of Syrian refugees living in a UNHCR refugee camp in Turkey, Jefee-Bahloul et al. surveyed 354 refugees using the \"HAD Stress\" screening instrument and found that 41.8% of those surveyed scored consistent with PTSD [28] .",

When writing about implementation of TMH in the Middle East, Jefee-Bahloul and Zayour argue that barriers often fall into one of four categories: \"cultural, technical, financial, and regulatory\" [34] . This appears to ring true across global settings. Barriers often include difficulty with technology (e.g., access to technology and internet; low bandwidth); limited familiarity with or openness to telemental health; scheduling across time zones; and the loss of nonverbal communication typically available for in-person interactions [28, 35] . In addition, consultation/supervision often requires cultural competency, with an avoidance of a colonial approach to transcultural consultation/supervision, and an awareness of language differences, cultural expectations and norms, but also attention to differences in ethical codes and regulations [35, 36] . Indeed, clear expression of emotions and mental health concerns may get lost in transcultural tele-consultation/supervision given cultural differences in emotions, mental health, and feeling self-conscious when speaking to a computer-based video camera. Attention to such cultural and ethical nuances in consultation/supervision may be challenging.",

Despite the high levels of mental health disabilities, more than 85% of people with severe mental illness in low-and middle-income countries do not receive the care they require [39] [40] [41] [42] . Levels of public expenditure on mental health are very meager in low-and middle-income countries, and more than 80% of these funds go to mental hospitals [43] ; in sub-Saharan Africa, less than 1% of the health budget is typically spent on mental health [44] . This small allocation is in countries where an already low proportion of the national budget is spent on health, and is often spent inefficiently, with almost all resources used at tertiary hospital-level services that are inaccessible to the majority of people [45] . Globally, the median number of mental health workers is 9 per 100,000 population, but there is extreme variation (from below 1 in some low-income countries to 72 in high-income countries) [43] . The median number of mental health beds per 100,000 ranges from below 7 in lowand lower-middle-income countries to over 50 in high-income countries. The attendant lockdown and social distancing further exacerbates the existing lack of access to mental health services in the low-resource countries, due to distance of service delivery points, unavailability of transport, fear of contracting COVID-19 at hospitals, and absence of mental health personnel. This may result in situations where individuals who develop mental health problems may not have early intervention while those with existing mental health challenges may experience a worsening of their symptoms as a result of an inability to access services, follow-up consultation, and medication. The need for remote communication technologies, such as the telephone, internet, or videophone, has the potential to mitigate many of these inequalities. The emergence of computer-aided technology alongside growth in the popularity of the internet has increased opportunities for real-time, long-distance consultations [46] . The telephone, in particular, is a widely available telecommunication technology that can be used as a mechanism for support and treatment delivery in low-resource countries. Thus, telemedicine and in particular TMH are helping to level the playing field, especially in resource-poor rural areas.",

The coalition was tasked with developing a TMH system including psychosocial counseling and mental health consultation help lines. This system provides psychological support and treatment to patients, patient relatives, and frontline health workers in addition to continued mental health support for patients who require follow-up sessions but could not access clinics due to lockdowns, patients in isolation wards, and quarantined patients and health workers. For example, the telemental health system based in the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Nigeria has an institutional COVID-19 psychosocial response team. The team is led by a Consulting Psychiatrist named Dr. Esther Okogbenin. The team offers TMH treatment and consultations, including mental health and psychosocial support, through dedicated phone lines to patients in isolation wards, relatives in quarantine, and group support sessions to the hospital frontline health workers via zoom conferences. In addition to providing support to patients in remote locations, the Irrua Hospital COVID-19 psychosocial response team provides consultation to frontline health workers, as follows [47] : This tele-consultation system with frontline health workers embodies \"best practices\" of TMH interventions in dire situations.",

Note that consultation practicum students acted as the consultants, and they were 26 graduate clinical and counseling psychology students whose consultation sessions were audiotaped. Supervisors reviewed their complete audiotapes each week, prior to tele-supervision. In addition, on-line weekly logs were required of each consultation practicum student to prepare them for weekly tele-supervision and facilitate their reflection and fidelity to the RRI manual; however, the fidelity expectations to the RRI manual were loose given the need to be adaptive to refugee teacher needs.",

The three supervision elements of close weekly tele-supervision, listening to audios uploaded to a secure cloud folder online, and online logs were necessary ingredients for consultation quality. Indeed, a number of the consultation practicum students said that they do not typically receive such supportive, intensive supervision from their other practicum sites, which, ironically, provide live, in-person supervision. Perhaps concerns about tele-supervision versus in-person supervision quality are overblown because high-quality supervision seems, to us, to be more dependent on the quality of the supervisor and opportunities for audio review and log reflection, instead of whether or not the supervision is in-person.",

As a result, tele-consultation/supervision has become the new norm of delivery, whether a consultee/supervisee is in a remote or nearby location. The need for quality tele-consultation/supervision support for mental health providers is profound, especially given the mental health consequences for communities impacted by a toxic combination of COVID-19, disaster, and/or conflict. Rates of mental health problems, especially PTSD, are much higher after both natural and manmade disasters [27] . For instance, victimization by intentional violence, like in the Syrian conflict, can lead to more complex trauma and high PTSD rates [28] . In low-resource, postdisaster settings, mental health needs are high, availability of in-person consultation/supervision is low, and high-quality mental health delivery is often difficult to provide due to lack of training and educational opportunities [15, 24, 29] . Therefore, tele-consultation/supervision may narrow the gap in quality mental health services in low-resource settings. The novel contribution of this paper is our proposed tele-consultation/supervision model, literature review, and case studies supporting the argument that TMH consultation/supervision can be beneficial for the client, the mental health provider, and the entire mental health system's functioning and effectiveness, especially when the patients and providers are located in hard-to-reach, low-resource settings [18\u2022] .",

The model posits that the provision of tele-supervision to a provider can mitigate the negative impact of disasters and conflict on mental health.

For instance, if a patient becomes agitated or suicidal, then you can keep them safe in a clinic setting, but the same is not true for a tele-health visit. In a tele-health context, a safety protocol would, for example, involve knowing the current location of the patient in order to get them immediate help, if needed. We recommend that the tele-consultant/supervisor encourages and supports their consultee/ supervisee's development of patient safety protocols.",

A one-time meeting is just not the same as regular, ideally weekly, consultation/supervision, in which not only can quality control be conducted but the supervisee can also build trust and a relationship with the supervisor over time, compared to sporadic or one-time consultation. Such trust is necessary for an open, honest, high-quality consultation/ supervision to be conducted [53] . Also, the Nigerian case example demonstrates the importance of not only the teleconsultant but also of the support provided by the entire teleconsultation system that Nigeria put in place as a coalition to respond to serious mental health demands due to COVID-19.",
