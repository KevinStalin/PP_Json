The primary endpoint was the time until a viral RNA negative conversion for SARS-CoV-2 in all clinical samples. The secondary clinical endpoint was the time of CT imaging improvement. Data analysis was performed per protocol. This study was registered with chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2000030262. Findings: Between March 23 and May 23 of 2020, 86 COVID-19 patients with symptoms of moderate illness were recruited, and 6 patients were excluded due to not matching the inclusion criteria (patients with pneumonia through chest radiography). Among the remaining 80 patients, 40 patients were assigned to experimental group, and the others were assigned to control group to only receive standard care. Efficacy and safety were evaluated for both groups. The time of viral RNA negative conversion in experimental group (Mean, 3\u00a280 days, 95% CI 2\u00a207\u00c05\u00a253), was significantly shorter than that in control group (7\u00a240 days, 95% CI 4\u00a257 to 10\u00a223) (p = 0.031), and difference between means was 3\u00a260 days. The percentage of patients in experimental group with reversion to negative viral RNA was significantly increased compared with control group on all sampling days (every day during the 12day observation period) (p = 0\u00a2037). For the secondary endpoint, the experimental group had a significantly shorter time until improvement was seen by CT (Mean 6\u00a221 days, N = 38/40, 95% CI 5\u00a211\u00c07\u00a231) than that in control group (8\u00a276 days, N = 34/40, 95% CI 7\u00a257\u00c09\u00a296) (p = 0.002), and difference between means was 2\u00a255 days. No discomfort or complications during aerosol inhalation were reported to the nurses by any experimental patients. Interpretation: In conclusion, we found that aerosol inhalation of IFN-k plus TFF2 in combination with standard care is safe and superior to standard care alone in shortening the time up to viral RNA negative conversion in all clinical samples. In addition, the patients in experimental group had a significantly shortened CT imaging improvement time than those in control group. This study suggested that this combination treatment is able to facilitate clinical improvement (negative for virus, improvement by CT, reduced hospitalization stay) and thereby result in an early release from the hospital. These data support the need for exploration with a large-scale trial of IFN-k plus TFF2 to treat COVID-19.",

On the one hand, several clinical studies have shown that HCQ treatment had a favorable effect, including shortened body temperature recovery time and cough remission time; decreased pneumonia proportion, as assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan [3] ; alleviated symptoms; and decreased C reactive protein concentration [4] . On the other hand, a French study conducted in 181 COVID-19 patients with relatively severe illness did not show any difference regarding transfer to the ICU or death [5] . Furthermore, in a large-scale observational study involving hospitalized COVID-19 patients, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either intubation or death [6] . In addition, compassionate use of a nucleotide analog, remdesivir, contributed to clinical improvement in patients with severe COVID-19 in a small study [7] . However, two recent larger clinical trials showed that remdesivir in adults hospitalized with COVID-19 was not associated with statistically significant clinical benefits, except for shortening the time to recovery, which was accompanied by serious adverse events [8, 9] . Other antiviral agents, such as lopinavir-ritonavir, were also shown to have no benefit in hospitalized adult patients with severe COVID-19 [10] . Therefore, new effective antiviral agents need to be developed to combat COVID-19.",

            "text": "Blood from patients with severe COVID-19 had impaired type I interferon activity and exacerbated inflammatory responses [11] . An in vitro study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 was sensitive to type I interferon pretreatment [12] . In a small-scale clinical trial, treatment with IFN-a2b significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract and elevated the blood levels of the inflammatory markers, IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) [13] . In addition, early triple-antiviral therapy with a combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospitalization stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 [14] . However, the persistent inflammatory responses resulting from IFN-a/b may cause damage to infected patients. In the study, interferon beta-1b was injected only before day 7 from symptom onset to avoid its proinflammatory effects [14] . Interferon kappa (IFN-k) is a relatively mild type I interferon that can effectively inhibit the replication of enveloped viruses, including Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), Influenza avian virus (IAV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and others, by activating the interferon-stimulated response element signaling pathway [15] . However, unlike IFN-a2 or IFN-b, the antiviral activity of IFN-k is cell-associated [16] ; IFN-k inhibits the replication of influenza virus largely through the IFNAR-MAPK-Fos-CHD6 axis [17] , whereas the effects of IFN-a2 or IFN-b are mainly through the STAT1 pathway. Trefoil factor 2 (TFF2) is a small secreted polypeptide that promotes the repair of injury and reduces the inflammatory response [18, 19] . Our previous clinical pilot study indicated that aerosol inhalation of IFN-k plus TFF2 is a safe treatment and is able to significantly facilitate clinical improvement, including cough relief, CT imaging improvement, and viral RNA reversion, thereby resulting in an early release from hospitalization without induction of a proinflammatory response [20] .",

Patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study, assigned with randomized numbers, the random allocation sequence was generated through the website \"https://www.randomizer.org/#randomize\", and then sorted into either experimental group or control group. Based on the purpose of this study and our previous explorative pilot study [20] , considering 20% of shedding cases, we calculated that a sample of approximately 40 participants per group was required for approximately 85% statistical power in using a two-sided, two-sample t-test by PASS v15 software, assuming the true difference between the means to be -3, with standard deviation of 4. The significance level (alpha) of the test is 0\u00a205. Therefore, 80 eligible patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either IFN-k plus TFF2 or control group with standard care at a ratio of 1:1 by a simple randomization with no stratification. Consequently, 40 patients were assigned to experimental group, and 40 patients for control group. The age, sex, baseline demographics, and laboratory test results in each group were comparable. Fever and unproductive cough were the most common presenting signs and symptoms. No significant differences were observed between two groups at baseline (Table 1) . No discomfort or complications during aerosol inhalation were reported to the nurses by the patients in the study.

In addition, experimental group was significantly less hospitalized (Mean 15\u00a250, 95% CI 13\u00a277\u00c017\u00a223) in comparison with control group (20\u00a205, 95% CI 17\u00a267\u00c022\u00a243) (p = 0\u00a20025), and the difference between means was 4\u00a255 (Fig. 2D ). The hospitalization time for patients staying in the hospital was longer than the our last study [20] , because the clinical research at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center had revised the discharge evaluation criteria (including nasal CT improvement which is usually taking prolonged times).",

Interestingly, a significant less CRP was noticed in experimental group on day 2 when compared with that in control group, p = 0.006 (Fig. 3E) , suggesting the administration of IFN-k plus TFF2 might facilitate rapid containing of inflammation. We then analyzed the kinetic changes in the effectiveness index in the peripheral blood of control group and experimental group. The total white blood cell (WBCs) absolute counts, blood platelet counts and lymphocyte counts were all not significantly different between two groups, which suggested that IFN-k plus TFF2 treatment had no significant effect on total blood parameters (Fig. 3F\u00c0H) . After treatment for 12 days, all blood indexes returned to values in the normal range. We further determine the kinetic of different lymphocyte subsets (CD3 + T, CD4 + T, CD8 + T and CD16 + CD56 + NK) in the peripheral blood of two groups of patients. CD3 + T, CD4 + T, CD8 + T cell counts in both groups were continuously increasing whereas NK cells remained stable during the whole clinical observation with no significant differences at every time point between two groups, and all were fallen in the normal ranges for both groups (Fig. 4A\u00c0D ). In addition, the level of plasma cytokines from those patients with moderate COVID-19 was low, and the inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8) in the early stage (1~6 days) in experimental group showed a slight fluctuation temporarily; however, after 6 days of aerosol inhalation treatment, the level of plasma cytokines gradually decreased, and showed lower than that in control group, except for IL-22 (Fig. 5) .

Furthermore, CT improvement time in experimental group was significantly shorter, by 2\u00a255 days, than that in control group. In addition, IFN-k plus TFF2 treatment significantly shortened the duration of hospitalization. The side effects of the combined aerosol treatment were generally mild and self-limiting. The results were highly consistent with the first clinical study of IFN-k plus TFF2 in patients with moderate COVID-19 [20] .",

            "text": "Specific highly active antiviral drugs for any emerging infectious disease are always needed because the development of a new antiviral drug through the preclinical and clinical stages takes years before its approval for clinical use. When the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic suddenly emerged, most of the antiviral research focused on therapeutic agents with some in vitro activity against betacoronavirus, including favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir-ritonavir, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and interferons [24\u00c032]. These drugs have known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, side effects, and dosing regimens. Unfortunately, most studies have shown limited therapeutic effects in COVID-19 patients, and some effective therapeutics in published papers have been questioned for various reasons [33] . Lopinavir-ritonavir was shown to have similar effects to placebo on reducing viral load, despite some improvement in symptoms [10] . In patients with severe COVID-19 receiving compassionate-use remdesivir, clinical improvement was observed in 36 of 53 patients (68%) [7] . In addition, the clinical efficacy of HCQ in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 is controversial. In summary, there has been no strong evidence reported so far for specific effects in the treatment of COVID-19. Interestingly, early triple-antiviral therapy with a combination of interferon beta-1b, lopinavir-ritonavir, and ribavirin was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 [14] . Interferon-a2b treatment for COVID-19 significantly reduced the duration of detectable virus in the upper respiratory tract [13] . These findings suggest that interferons should be further investigated as a therapy in COVID-19.",

In addition, the prognosis of COVID-19 patients has been associated with the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood [35] , and tocilizumab therapy has been applied to counteract the cytokine storm in patients with severe COVID-19 [36] . Thus, it is critical to examine whether treatment with IFN-k plus TFF2 influences inflammation in COVID-19 patients. CRP was monitored as an indicator of inflammatory responses and showed a lower level in experimental group than in control group, indicating that treatment with IFN-k plus TFF2 may eventually reduce inflammatory responses. In addition, plasma inflammatory cytokine test results showed that aerosol inhalation of IFN-k plus TFF2 did not significantly induce inflammation in patients with moderate COVID-19. The synergistic effect of IFN-k and TFF2 proteins shortened the duration of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients. Surprisingly, the higher level of IL-22 expression was maintained in experimental group. As known, TFF2 is able to improve the mucosal reconstitution while IL-22 is also known to facilitate the mucosal recovery [37] , it is possible that TFF2 could up-regulate IL-22 and exerts its functionality. Indeed, previous studies showed that IL-22 reduced lung inflammation and promoted lung epithelial repair during influenza virus infection [38, 39] . However, the relationship between IL-22 and prognosis in COVID-19 patients need to be further investigated.",

Recent reports show that patient lymphocyte counts exhibit a graded decline from mild, moderate and severe COVID-19 [35, 40] whereas mild and moderate COVID-19 patients remain normal [41] , which was consistent with our results. In addition, IFN-k and TFF2 are small proteins that could be endogenously induced to respond to respiratory viral infections [17] , therefore, they are safe and effective, convenient for transportation, and easy to prepare and use.
