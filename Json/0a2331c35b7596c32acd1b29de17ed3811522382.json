However, the origin of hepatic damage in COVID-19 is poorly understood and potentially involves systemic inflammation, viral replication or drug-induced liver injury. Today, we lack evidence for SARS-CoV-2 replication in the liver and our study renders drug-induced liver injury as cause of elevated liver enzymes very unlikely. We rather found a direct correlation between systemic inflammation (indicated by IL-6, CRP and ferritin) and liver damage. IL-6 production may stem from immune cells [32] fibroblasts, endothelial cells [33] and hepatocytes [27, 34] which orchestrates an hepatic acute phase response [32, 35, 36] . While IL-6 signaling impinges on hepatic regeneration [27] , clinical studies (that for example tested the effect of IL-6 administration in cancer patients) demonstrated a critical role of this pathway in hepatic injury and hepatotoxicity [37] [38] [39] . In line with a critical impact of systemic inflammation and specifically IL-6 on liver injury, we noted a direct correlation between acute phase proteins and IL-6 in the serum of COVID-19 patients with elevated AST. Based on previous reports and our study, with the limitation of the Cross-sectional design, we propose that the systemic inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection to COVID-19 patients serves as a fuel of hepatic injury. In line with this, our findings appeared more pronounced in COVID-19 patients with a more severe CRS (i.e. that required intensive care measures). Vice versa, tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the human IL-6 13 receptor, reversed liver injury during CRS that was induced by non-infectious means (i.e. CAR-T cell therapy) [40, 41] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 105, "end": 108, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 109, "end": 112, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 113, "end": 117, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 118, "end": 122, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 123, "end": 127, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 625, "end": 629, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 661, "end": 665, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 682, "end": 686, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 687, "end": 690, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 742, "end": 746, "text": "[32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 747, "end": 750, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 751, "end": 754, "text": "36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 811, "end": 815, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 996, "end": 1000, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1001, "end": 1005, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1006, "end": 1010, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1694, "end": 1696, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1807, "end": 1811, "text": "[40,", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1812, "end": 1815, "text": "41]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "While experimental evidence suggests that blockade of an inflammatory response in SARS-CoV-2-related CRS improves the course of infection [42, 43] , clinical trials are pending.

In COVID-19 patients, elevated IL-6 concentrations (amongst others) have been described [46] and a cytokine signature was indeed associated with loss of lung function, lung injury and outcome [47] . As such, it appears that SARS-CoV-2 potently triggers a systemic cytokine response that is detrimental for some patients (as in CRS) while factors that control this response remain undetermined. This cytokine response, but probably not viral burden, seems to play the key role in disease severity and patient outcome [48] .

Most COVID-19 patients reported fever (75.8%), cough (88.9%), muscle pain (66.7%) and fatigue (67.8%), whereas dyspnea was noted in 50% of patients.

Importantly, 61.8% of patients showed typical radiologic findings in imaging studies (chest X-ray or computed tomography). Most patients reported chronic diseases like hypertension (50.5%), type 2 diabetes (19.8%), pulmonary disease (11%) and 13.4% reported a history of smoking. During hospitalization (i.e. after liver enzyme testing) 66.3% of patients received antibiotic-therapy with cephalosporines in all cases to cover secondary infections, and 42.7% of patients received anti-viral therapy with favipiravir. Important to note, only 3 patients received antibiotic therapy and none received anti-viral therapy ahead of admission.
