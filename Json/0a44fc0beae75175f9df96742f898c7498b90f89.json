A challenge in identifying these patients is the speed at which patients can develop severe infections following exposure, and the widely varying estimates for case incidence of those infected (1) . Shortly after the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection was identified in New York State (March 1, 2020), Northwell Health, a large integrated health care system that serves the greater New York City region, began testing for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. Our first positive case was found on March 8 for a specimen collected on March 4. Over the next five weeks, Northwell Health Laboratories (NWL) identified positive cases of SARS-CoV-2 in 26,735 of the 180,458 persons (14.8%) identified in New York State (2) . With these data, we sought to understand the spread of SARS-CoV-2 through the greater New York metropolitan region.",

SARS-CoV-2 was already widespread in our geographic region during the first week of testing, based on the almost simultaneous appearance of SARS-CoV-2 patients residing in widely dispersed zip codes. However, different zip code areas with the same starting date displayed markedly diverse case burden over the course study period, as shown by the growth of cumulative case incidence (Figure 2A) . This diversity is further quantified (Figure 2B ): the percentage of the population cumulatively testing positive per zip code is plotted as a function of the days elapsed after identification of the first case in its respective zip code area (each circle denotes one zip code). On this semi-log plot, a 10-fold range in cumulative case incidence is observed across different zip codes for a fixed appearance date of the first case. The symmetric distribution of the points around the median (blue line) on a log scale indicates a long-tailed, log-normal type distribution, with a few extreme zip codes showing large percentages affected. One data point is Figure 3 . At first, predominantly hospitalized patients were tested (inpatient floor or intensive care unit). As case incidence and familiarity with SARS-CoV-2 clinical presentation increased, the fraction of testing dedicated to hospitalized patients decreased to approximately 20%, while testing in emergency departments, urgent care centers and other outpatient settings increased.",

Figure 6A shows the % of persons tested by NWL in each zip code, as a function of zip code average annual household income; no significant relationship is evident. Figure 6B shows SARS-CoV-2 % test positivity versus average annual household income by zip code. From $25,000 to $125,000 per annum, there is a strong negative correlation (R 2 = 0.35, p<0.0001). From $125,000 to $800,00 per annum, there is a slightly positive trend, which is not statistically significant. Supplemental Figure 3 shows that while the % of the population tested for SARS-CoV-2 by NWL did not correlate with zip code population and population density, there was a positive correlation of zip code % test positivity with these variables. Supplemental Figure 4A -B shows that zip code average annual household income inversely correlated with zip code population and population density. However, when our testing data was normalized to the respective fraction of the New York State-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing that NWL performed (Supplemental Figure 4C -F), the correlation of % test positivity with zip code average annual household income was eliminated. We therefore examined the relationship of NWL testing to zip code % persons below Poverty Level. Figure 7A shows the relationship of % of the population tested by Northwell per zip code to this variable, for the two counties in New York City for which such data were available and NWL testing represented greater than 20% of all SARS-CoV-2 testing performed. For Queens county but not Richmond county (Staten Island), there was a significant negative correlation between % testing versus % Poverty Level (R 2 0.34, p<0.02). Figure   7C shows the % of persons testing positive by Northwell for SARS-CoV-2 as a function of % Poverty Level.

However, our population sampling from these respective zip codes may have differed from the overall regional SARS-CoV-2 testing as reported by New York State. This premise is supported by the higher % test positivity rates experienced by NWL, particularly during the latter half of March. This may have resulted from differential presention of higher acuity patients from lower income zip codes to Northwell during the early phase of the pandemic, and hence differential sampling of the regional population.

Given literature estimates of serial intervals between infections (4 to 6 days, (1, 8) and R0 values of 2.6 to 3.2 during the exponential period of disease outbreak (9), it is unlikely that six cases from five geographically dispersed zip codes over the next four days could be explained by secondary infections from the first March 4 th case, or from exposure to the first A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 12 documented case in the New York City area on March 1 in Westchester County (10). It is more likely that the initially observed cases in our study originate from multiple infection sources already present across the geographical area when testing began (7) . While the initial patients tested by NWL had already been admitted to hospital for respiratory illness, the rapid increase in SARS-CoV-2 testing from emergency departments, urgent care centers and ambulatory practice sites reflects the realization that patients presenting with respiratory illness were likely to have this illness (11) .

Reliance on the 2010 census may also introduce inaccuracy in estimates of population cumulative case incidence, to the extent that the regional population has changed in the ensuing 10 years. Reliance on publicly available 2017 data from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and from the 2010 census permits correlative statements only to be made about the relationship of SARS-CoV-2 cumulative case incidence and geolocalized socioeconomic and racial factors. Lastly, the incompleteness of our patient-level data on racial status limits our ability to make statements about the impact of race on SARS-CoV-2 case incidence.",

Our geographic analysis supports the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 infection was widely distributed in the greater New York City region when virus testing became available in early March. Test % positivity rates were higher in patients from zip codes with higher population density and lower average annual household income. Our data emphasize the importance of detailed chronologic, geospatial and demographic analysis of regional populations as part of understanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 as a pandemic event.",
