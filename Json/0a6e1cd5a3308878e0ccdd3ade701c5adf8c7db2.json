Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis from 5 hospitals in a large health system in Massachusetts, comparing ED encounters from 3/1/2020-4/30/2020 to identical weeks from the prior year. Data collected included demographics, ESI, diagnosis, consultations ordered, bedside procedures, and inpatient procedures within 48 hours. We compared raw frequencies between time periods and calculated incidence rate ratios. Results: ED volumes decreased by 30.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. Average acuity of ED presentations increased, while most non-COVID-19 diagnoses decreased. The number and incidence rate of all non-critical care ED procedures decreased, while the occurrence of intubations and central lines increased. Most subspecialty consultations decreased, including to psychiatry, trauma surgery, and cardiology. Most nonelective procedures related to ED encounters also decreased, including craniotomies and appendectomies. Conclusion: Our health system experienced decreases in nearly all non-COVID-19 conditions presenting to EDs during the initial phase of the pandemic, including those requiring specialty consultation and urgent inpatient procedures. Findings have implications for both public health and health system planning.",

Nearly 60% of respondents also expressed concerns about not being able to have a visitor or guest present during their care in the ED. A number of studies have indeed shown decreased ED visits in the U.S. and other parts of the world during the COVID-19 surge, including reduced presentations of acute coronary syndromes and strokes [4] .

Data was extracted using Structured Query Language (SQL) queries of the SQL data warehouse of our EHR, and no manual chart abstraction was performed. There was only manual review of several charts to confirm that each variable extracted accurately. For demographic data, we accounted for missing data differently for race, ethnic group, and language preference. If the patient's race was missing, we considered those data as null. For ethnic group we imputed missing data to \"non-Hispanic,\" and similarly for language preference we imputed missing data to \"Englishspeaking,\" as we found that these demographic fields were often documented by exception by the registration staff.",

We also extracted the number of patients who tested J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f positive for COVID-19 within the ED during the early pandemic period. Of note, this COVID-19 testing was conducted with Real Time PCR assays conducted in our own hospital's microbiology lab. The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) code of the primary ED diagnosis was mapped using Clinical Classifications Software Refined (CCSR) v2020.3, a software tool provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [14] .

The lower numbers of cardiac catheterizations and appendectomies may have been influenced by a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f preference for conservative approaches by proceduralists in the COVID-19 era [15] , but there also do seem to be \"missing cases\" as other studies have observed [12] . Accompanying the decrease in cases was a mostly proportional decline in subspecialty consultations, except for a marked proportional rise in infectious disease consultations as a result of COVID-19. One exception to the decrease in procedures was an increase in laparotomies performed during the early pandemic period compared to the baseline period. There have been reports suggesting mesenteric ischemia requiring surgery as a thromboembolic complication of COVID-19 [16] [17] , and delayed presentations of surgical conditions such as appendicitis or cholecystitis could also have led to more laparotomies for peritonitis; this finding and the underlying explanations merit future study.",

It is also certainly possible that some portion of care usually provided in the ED was occurring in other settings, such as through telemedicine consultations. As others have noted [10] , however, it is unlikely that all of the declines observed can be attributed to a decrease in actual incidence of disease or a shift in care settings, particularly for the more severe disease states requiring procedures. Our findings therefore echo others' concerns that some patients avoided care for emergency conditions that likely warranted expedient care during the COVID-19 surge.",

It would appear that fewer inpatient procedural, but more critical care resources were required to support emergency care needs during the surge. EDs can likely reduce resources devoted to low and mid-acuity cases as well as most bedside procedures during such times, but must have the personnel and equipment required to perform more critical care interventions. At a time of financial stress like the early COVID-19 pandemic, being able to predict supply and equipment needs in this way is crucial. In contrast to ED procedures, the decrease in consultation requests and inpatient procedures was relatively evenly distributed across specialties; while ENT and ophthalmology did see the largest proportional decrease, even neurosurgery and trauma surgery witnessed substantial consultation reductions. The patterns observed may help to inform the allocation of operating room resources and surgical staff in similar future scenarios, which may be particularly important at a time when staff are being redeployed to new roles.",

However, we also know it can be difficult for patients to predict when they truly require an emergency department evaluation or not [19] .
