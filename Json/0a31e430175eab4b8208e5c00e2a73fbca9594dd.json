Innovative strategies that allow lifting of societally disruptive control measures without increasing transmission and initiating a next pandemic wave are, therefore, urgently needed. Testing for infection with SARS-CoV-2 followed by contact tracing is instrumental in controlling spread, but is seriously hampered by diagnostic delays inherent to the use of high-throughput RT-PCR [Kretzschmar et al. (2020) ]. Novel rapid testing technologies, such as antigen-based tests and LAMP, can reduce diagnostic delays to several minutes [R\u00f6del et al. (2020) ]. Moreover, such tests can identify symptomatic and asymptomatically infected subjects with high Yet, compared to PCR-based testing, test sensitivity of rapid tests ranges from 70% to 90%, with false-negative results reported mainly in samples with low viral loads (i.e., high CT values), that may reflect subjects with low likelihood of being infectious [Gremmels et al. (2020) ]. Nonetheless, such tests can facilitate a shift from finding infected individuals to finding infectious individuals [Mina et al. (2020) ], thus potentially having sufficient impact on transmission to control spread effectively, i.e., with a minimum set of acceptable additional measures.",

            "text": "Over the course of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, testing strategies focused mainly on symptomatic individuals and individuals in high-risk groups (e.g., healthcare workers, staff and residents of long-term care facilities). The impact of these strategies on the reproduction number has been investigated in a modelling study [Grassly et al. (2020) ]. Later into the pandemic, many countries expanded testing to include individuals, irrespective of whether they are displaying symptoms. Expanded testing strategies are based on the assumption that undetected asymptomatic and mild cases not reporting to healthcare can have a substantial impact on transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Population-wide testing at regular time intervals, also referred to as mass screening or universal testing, is now under serious consideration as a strategy to maintain incidence at manageable levels despite drastic reductions of control measures that are most disruptive to society [European Center for Disease Prevention and Control, (2020), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2020)]. Such an approach refers to testing a certain (substantial) part of the population, irrespective of the presence of symptoms, followed by isolation of infected subjects to interrupt transmission. The ultimate goal of such a strategy is to maintain the effective reproduction number R e below 1, once it has been brought to such a level by the intensive measures. However, the effectiveness of such a strategy has not been determined. Apart from testing frequency, the effectiveness of regular universal testing depends on at least five other variables: (1) test sensitivity, which may vary according to the day since acquisition of infection [Kucirka et al. (2020) ]; (2) the proportion of the population tested; (3) the effectiveness of isolation of infected persons; (4) the risk of transmission originating from subjects with false-negative test results and of (5) those that were not tested. Variables (4) and (5) relate to the level of reduction in R 0 that is achieved by a basic set of control measures that remains in place. Subjects with false-negative test results may no longer adhere to these control measures and, therefore, may create conditions in which the number of secondary cases per primary case can grow above the threshold 1, and even approach levels observed at the onset of the pandemic, for which R 0 is typically between 2 and 3 [Li et al. (2020) ; ].",

For simplicity, we define effectiveness as an overall reproduction number due to the random testing strategy (R rt ) below 1 for the whole population with different levels of reopening society. The basic scenario is that all measures are lifted for tested subjects, and that non-tested subjects adhere to measures that control SARS-CoV-2 transmission so that R e = 1.3. We also analyze scenarios where all subjects adhere to measures that control SARS-CoV-2 transmission to R e = 1.3 or where all measures are lifted for all subjects. Complete reopening of society (i.e., lifting of all measures) allows SARS-CoV-2 transmission with R e that is equal to R 0 which we assume to be either 2.0 or 2.5.",

We assume that testing individuals participate in high-risk transmission events (i.e., where large crowds gather), and, thus, could generate more secondary infections than non-testing individuals, who are not permitted at these high-risk events. We assume that testing and non-testing individuals mix randomly during low-risk events, and that during high-risk events there is only transmission between testing individuals. Given a test-strategy -which is defined by a combination of the proportion of the population who tests regularly and the time interval between subsequent tests -we calculate the number of secondary cases of testing and nontesting individuals and how they are distributed over these two categories. Knowledge of these numbers allows us to determine the overall reproduction number R rt for a given testing strategy.",

The discretized probability distribution between day t -1 and day t is denoted by g(t). We further assume that a fraction p of the individuals in the population gets tested every k days for SARS-CoV-2 (testing individuals). The sensitivity of this test depends on the time since the tested individual got infected. This time-dependent sensitivity, s(t), was based on the results of [Gremmels et al. (2020) , Moeren van der et al. (2020)], (see Figure 1 and Supplementary  Table S1 ). In our basic scenario we assume the same sensitivity for an antigen-based test and a PCR-test. As there is little data to accurately determine the sensitivity of a test to detect infectiousness, we also performed a sensitivity analysis in which assume that on every day since acquisition of the virus test sensitivity for detecting infectiousness was 80%.",

            "text": "The sensitivity to detect infectious subjects in the early stage of infection is an important parameter in our model. Yet, in the absence of accurate data, the infectiousness in time can only be derived indirectly. The relation between test-sensitivity, infectiousness and the effect of isolation is complex, for at least two reasons. First, the generation distribution describes the average proportion of infected subjects being infectious since the moment of virus acquisition (Ferretti et al. 2020 ). This distribution depends on preventive measures taken. For instance, effective isolation after symptom onset, will reduce the likelihood of transmission at the later stages of the infectious period, thereby changing the generation time and shortening the generation interval. The correct distribution of infectiousness, therefore, depends on the measures taken to reduce the reproduction number. Second, there is considerable variation in timing of infectivity between individuals. As infectivity, viral load and test sensitivity are correlated, this implies similar variation in testsensitivity between individuals. Subjects being highly infectious shortly after virus acquisition will most likely have high viral loads at that time, and hence, higher likelihoods to be detected by testing. Consider a test that will detect all individuals who are infectious, but not those in their latency period, and all detected subjects will be isolated immediately with 100% effective isolation. If 10% of infected individuals are infectious one day after acquisition, only 10% of all individuals tested on that day, respective to acquisition, will be detected and isolated. Yet, this will prevent transmission at that point of time and only latently infected individuals that become infectious at later stages will contribute to transmission. Assuming a test sensitivity for detecting infectious subjects of 10% will then be an underestimate, whereas assuming a test sensitivity of 100% will be an overestimate. We have, therefore, considered several scenarios for the infectiousness profile and test sensitivity.",
