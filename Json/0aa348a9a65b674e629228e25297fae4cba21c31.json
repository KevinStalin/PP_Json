We study the effects of the policy actions on the progression of the pandemic in the first containment period in spring 2020 before easing of measures have started to work by the end of April. To exploit both the time and spatial dimension in the dissemination of the virus, we conduct a spatial data panel analysis for German NUTS-3 regions. Specifically, we employ a spatial differencein-differences approach to identify the effects of individual public health measures. We find that contact restrictions and closure of schools substantially contributed to flattening the infection curve. Additionally, a strong treatment effect of wearing face masks is established in the few treated regions during the containment phase. No incremental effect is evidenced for closure of establishments and shutdown of shopping malls and other stores. These findings prove to be highly robust to changes in model specification. By contrast, the dampening effect of restaurant closure is sensitive to model variation.",

When we take the example of Germany, there was initially a strong political consensus that policy measures should be identical across federal states.

Yet, given the federal structure of Germany, some variation exists. The regulations were usually enacted at the level of federal states. For each of the 6 public health measures we are taking into account, we find differences in the timing of implementation of up to one week. Additionally, in a few urban and rural regions within the states, regulations come into force on still different dates.",

The treatment effect of 13 \u00bd percentage points of wearing face masks is only based on a few regions treated in the containment phase. In consequence, the impact of the mask duty can be estimated with less precision in our sample settings than that of contact restrictions (see for an alternative study design focusing specifically on the Covid-19 effects of face masks). A highly significant dampening effect of 5 \u00bd percentage point is also found for the closure of schools and daycare facilities. No significant incremental effects are identified for closure of establishments and the shutdown of shopping malls and other stores.

Complementary studies at the aggregate national level, which deal with the question if governmental restrictions to public and private life have managed to \"flatten\" Germany's infection curve during the first wave of the pandemic in spring 2020, can, for instance, be found in Dehning et al. (2020) , Hartl et al. (2020) , Donsimoni et al. (2020a/b) , Glogowsky et al. (2020) , and Wieland (2020a) .

This limits the interpretation in terms of the underlying causal mechanisms and prevents the studies from differentiating between the specific effects of alternative of policy measures implemented over time. The international comparison study of Flaxman et al. (2020) tries to account for the latter by estimating disaggregate effects for different types of non-pharmaceutical interventions (including full lockdown, ban on public event, school closure, self-isolation and social distancing) on Covid-19 reproduction and death rates in European countries (including Germany). Similar to the above-mentioned single country studies for Germany, this cross-country approach finds that large-scale lockdowns of populations have an identifiable large effect on disease transmission, i.e. reduce Covid-19 infection rates by approx. 81%. However, with regard to the attempt of disentangling the effects of different policy measures, the authors have to conclude that the close spacing of interventions in time does not allow to properly identify the individual effects of other interventions than large-scale lockdowns.",

All three studies encompass in the spatio-temporal dynamics of the Covid-19 epidemic in Germanyboth in terms of data and estimation. Berlemann and Haustein (2020) use data at the county level (NUTS3 regions) to estimate an epidemic-endemic model for regional counts of newly infected persons. Their empirical model chiefly builds on an autoregressive process of disease dynamics augmented by spatial lag terms (comprising the epidemic part of the model) together with a deterministic time trend (endemic part) and random regional effects. The authors use this model to evaluate the effectiveness of three waves of containment measures, namely 1. ban of mass events, 2. closure of educational institutions, leisure facilities and retail facilities together with and international traveling restrictions, 3.

Although Berlemann and Haustein do not explicitly consider space-time discontinuities in the implementation of policy interventions across federal states, their analysis of regional responses to a common intervention shock further indicates that a one size-fits-all policy is not optimal from a regional perspective, i.e. implemented policy measures helped to slowdown the infection dynamics in those federal states that were most severely affected by Covid-19 but did note change infection trajectories in other states. Similar to Berlemann and Haustein, the results reported in Wieland (2020b) provide mixed evidence for a regional trend change in infections around the timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions. As the author points out, in nearly two thirds of German counties the flattening of the infection curve was found to occur before the full lockdown came into force on March 23 and one in eight counties even experienced a decline of infections even before the closures of schools, child day care facilities and retail stores. Kergassner et al. (2020) model the regional infection dynamics in Germany considering the three waves of containment measures as studied by Berlemann and Haustein and, in addition, account for federal-state-specific starting dates of these measures. The results from a coupled SIQRD epidemic and mobility network model show that infection rates during the time period considered show a significant degree of heterogeneity across federal states and, accounting for this spatial heterogeneity, significantly improves model predictions at the federal state and county level. Kergassner et al. use the spatially resolved model to infer the effect of infections stemming from selected seeds such as 1) Heinsberg in Germany during the Carnival season and 2) returning travelers from Ischgl in Austria. Based on their empirical findings the authors conclude that refraining from traveling and large events are two key interventions that can effectively attenuate the spreading of Covid-19 at the subnational level. Felbermayr et al. (2020) similarly report that the road distance to Ischgl is an important predictor of infection cases across German counties. When assessing the superspreader effects over time, Felbermayr et al. find that restrictions in mobility after March 23 have helped contain the virus imported from Ischgl in those counties where it first arrived.",

Blum and Pinkovskiy particularly focus on analysing discontinuities in Covid-19 cases along the West-East internal German border. Starting from the hypothesis that the observed macro-regional heterogeneities between West and East Germany may be driven by different vaccination policies during the Cold War era (especially linked to the BCG vaccine against tuberculosis), in the course of their empirical investigation the authors do not find empirical support for this BCG hypothesis but show that commuting patterns and regional demographic structures are significant factors explaining regional differences in Covid-19 cases and deaths per capita.",

This difference is used to define alternative treatment groups based on the days between the county-specific start of the epidemic and the lockdown measured through retail closures between March 17 and 20, which are grouped into an early, intermediate and late intervention group. The results indicate that regions in the late intervention group, i.e. those regions that have experienced a longer temporal lag between the start of the local infection and the German-wide lockdown, indeed come with higher death rates.

German authorities (RKI, 2020a) measure the number of reported infections by day of reporting and by day of appearance of first symptoms. Because around one third of the observations lack accurate information on day of first symptoms, we use the day of reporting in our study.

While the containment effect of contact restrictions is great, the impact of school closing is still noticeable. The overall effect of the closure of restaurants is markedly smaller. Its lower 95% confidence band is only just above the observed infection trajectory.

Two alternative spatial panel data models appear to be of special interest. One is the spatial autoregressive (SAR) model that makes allowance for endogenous spatial spillovers but neglects policy intervention. in neighbouring regions. The other is the general nesting spatial (GNS) model that accounts for spatial spillovers in the endogenous variables, the policy variables and the disturbances. Figure 4 shows limited variations between the effect estimates of the three spatial models. The estimated response coefficients of contact restrictions, wearing of face mask, school closure and restaurant closure are statistically significant in all models. While weak significant effects of establishment and shopping mall closure is suggested by the SAR model (blue bars), the nonsignificance of both containment measures is corroborated by the GNS model (red bars). However, the problems of overparameterization and weakly identifiability of the GNS model becomes evident (Elhorst 2014, 32-33) . Estimates of the spatial autoregressive coefficients for endogenous spillovers (0.1721) and error dependence (-0.1038) are blown up with opposing signs (Elhorst 2017) .

This holds especially for the effects of contact restrictions and mandatory face mask wearing. Statistical significance of school closure and restaurant closure is most notably confirmed with increased delays. For school closure, significance comes along with an intensified treatment effect. The deviations for the lag of 5 days may be due to the short interval for identifying impacts arising from this specific measure.

Figure 6 compares the estimation results for the original and smoothed infection data. It is evident that the response coefficients of public health measure are not substantially affected by the filtering procedure. With increasing order of the moving average, the nonsignificant regression coefficient of shopping mall closure approaches zero. Also, the estimated effects of contact restrictions and face mask wearing decrease, but without losing their relative strength. However, filtering newly registered cases is a data transformation that changes their dispersion. Thus, averaging the original data has expected attenuation effects on the standard errors.

Parallel to this, other restrictions have been gradually lifted to allow for a re-opening of the economy. Our identification strategy takes up temporal changes and regional differences of implemented regulations. The spatial differences-in-differences (DiD) model exploits the variations of the policy actions to identify their infection effects. In the quasi-experimental approach, we involve region-specific trends to account for the parallel trend assumption. We are convinced that the study design is adequate to identify causal effects of the public health measures. The spatial econometric framework allows for inter-regional policy effects as well as endogenous spatial infections spillovers.

On that score, the response coefficients of the spatial Durbin model have been re-assessed by impact analysis. We found the greatest containment effect of nearly 14 percentage points for contact restrictions, followed by wearing of face masks with about 13\u00bd percentage points. While the impact of contact restrictions is grounded on comprehensive regional implementations during the period of study, that of face mask wearing is only based on a few treated regions during the covered containment phase until April 24. But both measures are thus effective in flattening the German pandemic curve. However, the more variable (and in absolute terms smaller) impact of mask wearing is a consequence of our sample design to not confound the effects from containment and easing measures.",

Reverse causation is always a concern when policymakers just react to accelerating infection rates. We believe that the design of our study is suitable to avoid a noticeable endogeneity bias. However, this strictly applies only to the measures being in the specific chronological order of their implementation. Thus, the containment effect of closure of schools and daycare facilities is backed under the condition that the intervention takes place before contact restrictions and the mask duty are introduced. The same holds for the unstable effect of restaurant closure. In this light, particularly the face mask effect appears to be significant and well grounded (also . Also, the continued imposition of the contact restrictions by the states turns out to be well justified. In particular, a low impact of this measure on infection growth would question the efficacy of such severe constraints.

While detailed cost-benefit analyses are scarcely available yet, some studies aim to tackle this issue for selected measures. Fuchs-Sch\u00fcndeln, Kuhn and Tertilt (2020) find strong labor market effects in the wake of school and child-care center closures. They estimate that 8.4 percent of total working hours will be lost, corresponding to 11.7 million employed persons in short-time-work. Beyond this short-term effect, intergenerational mobility and gender equality in the workplace is likely negatively affected. The macroeconomic impact of this public health measure is considered large.

While a moderate decline in DGP of 0.7 percent is estimated for the ban of mass gatherings and closure of public venues, restricting domestic travel may induce a large reduction up to 6 percent. Economic effects of social-distancing policies are investigated by Strong and Welburn (2020) and Fernand\u00e9z-Villaverde and Jones (2020).

Both ways of reporting have their advantages and disadvantages. Data by date of reporting is cyclical over the week. Incidences systematically fall over the weekend and are highest around the mid of the week. At weekends, testing is reduced and local health authorities are usually closed (RKI, 2020b). As reporting does not relate one-to-one to the spread of infections, employing reporting data introduces additional measurement uncertainty. This would suggest working with incidence data by day of diagnosis.However, data by day of diagnosis has disadvantages as well. Not all cases reported to the RKI come with the date of diagnosis. In many cases, we only know the day of reporting. As the figures show, more than one fourth of the data of the data is still by day of reporting. For these cases, knowledge on the day of first appearance of symptoms is missing. The share the data provided by day of reporting seems to increase over time.There is one great advantage of using data by day of diagnosis. The median delay between infection and appearance of symptoms is 5.2 days with 95% lying between 2 and 12 days (Linton et al., 2020 and Lauer et al., 2020) . When we are interested in the effect of some containment measure on the number of infections and use data by day of diagnosis, we would expect that the about 50% of the effect is visible five days after the measure was implemented.",
