It deconstructs the mechanisms by which the federal income tax system operates to affect the transmission of income shocks to consumption, and therefore, consumption inequality. To this end, it links micro and macro models of the distribution of income and consumption to changes in the federal income tax system. We find important changes in the types of income shocks to which consumers are insured or not, as well as the extent to which tax policy contributes to insuring consumers from these shocks. Importantly, we find that without decomposing the tax system into the three mechanisms outlined in the model, economists might have erroneously inferred that the role of tax policy as a mechanism for consumption insurance did not change over time. We also find that tax policy changes have disproportional effects across socioeconomic groups, and that this contributes to increasing inequality.",

Household welfare depends on how these income shocks are transmitted to consumption, and this transmission directly affects inequality. This relationship has led academics to investigate whether households are insulated from these income shocks (Blundell et al., 2008; Violante, 2010, 2014) . Answering these questions is exceptionally timely, as they contribute to a broader debate about rising income and consumption inequality in the United States, and have been central in political debates. 1 This debate includes academic studies focused on identifying the nature of these income shocks and evaluating their impacts on income inequality. 2 At the center of these studies is tax policy and its ability to reduce the variance of after-tax income compared to pre-tax income. This paper contributes to this debate by providing new evidence on how income taxes directly and indirectly affect household welfare.",

Specifically, they find that while tax policy dampens income shocks, a substantial portion of permanent income shocks is transmitted to consumption, and the transmission of these shocks has remained steady over time -even through major tax reforms, such as the Tax Reform Act of 1986. On the other hand, Bargain et al. (2015) finds that tax policy changes in the US substantially increased income inequality, using micro-data of US tax revenue to simulate changes between the pre-and post-tax incomes of taxpayers. To reconcile these two pieces of evidence, we combine these methods into a comprehensive model that deconstructs the effects of tax policy changes on the transmission of income shocks to consumption.",

First, we expand the typical period analyzed to over four decades, covering 1968-2010, which enables us to cover a large number of minor and major tax policy changes. Second, to incorporate these additional years, we update the model that links transmission parameters with moments of income and consumption conditions. Third, we combine microsimulations of changes in individual tax liabilities due to changes in tax policy, with a macro-labor model to directly link tax policy changes to the transmission of consumption from income shocks.",

We also show that previous estimates of this transmission might be limited by modeling choices and underlying assumptions, some of which might defy the data. Following pioneering work by Kaplan and Violante (2010) , our model captures several key features of the data; for example, that some individuals are credit-constrained. We show that this generalization of the model leads to lower estimates of the transmission of permanent income shocks to consumption and, thus, greater insurance. Together, we find that 26% of permanent income shocks are transmitted to consumption, which is substantially lower than the 64% found by Blundell et al. (2008) .",

These findings are the result of an important innovation in our model to describe tax policy changes. We decompose tax policy changes in three parts: active tax policy, passive tax policy, and behavioral changes in tax policy. Active tax changes measure the changes between pre-and post-tax incomes that are entirely due to legislative acts that affect tax rates or the tax code, such as the Tax Reform Act of 1986. These changes are the mechanical effects of tax policy found in studies that use micro-simulations of tax liability (Bargain et al., 2015) . In practice, the change in insurance due to active tax policy changes is measured in the simulation by holding income fixed to a base year and allowing the tax schedule to change as observed. Our simulations of active tax policy changes show a dramatic decrease in the amount of insurance the federal income tax provides in 1987, corresponding exactly with the Tax Reform Act of 1986.",

In practice, they are measured by keeping the tax code fixed to a base year while allowing the income distribution to change as observed. To further ensure that passive changes are not affected by the tax system, we remove changes in observed income due to labor responses to changes in taxation. The resulting measure of passive tax policy changes is more likely to represent exogenous changes in income distribution (e.g., technological growth). Behavioral changes represent all other changes including individual responses to active and passive tax changes, precautionary savings, aversion to risk, and individuals' perceptions of the tax system.

Consider two households with pre-tax incomes of $10,000 and $60,000. We can measure pre-tax income inequality by the coefficient of variation of 101; the mean is $35,000, the standard deviation is $35,355, and the coefficient of variation is the ratio of the standard deviation and the mean. Suppose the tax system consists of two brackets with a cut-off at $30,000, such that the lowest bracket is taxed at 15 percent, and the second bracket is taxed at 25 percent. After-tax income inequality, measured as the coefficient of variation, decreases to 98.9; after-tax incomes are $8,500 and $48,000, with a mean of $28,250 and standard deviation $27,930. This calculation demonstrates the role income taxation can play in decreasing after-tax income inequality. Now consider how a change in the tax code can contribute to changing after-tax inequality with an active tax policy change. Specifically, consider an increase in the top marginal income tax rate from 25 to 29 percent, keeping constant the income distribution and behavioral responses to tax changes.

Finally, consider a passive tax policy change where income tax rates remain at 15 and 25 percent, but incomes increase by 20 percent to $12,000 and $72,000 for the two income groups, respectively. Suppose that this increase in income is entirely due to exogenous changes (e.g., technological growth), and keeping constant taxpayers' behavioral responses to changes in income distribution. After-tax income inequality decreases to 98.5. In this scenario, even though the tax system did not change, its non-linearity contributed to a decrease in after-tax inequality.",

In particular, active tax policy changes increased the transmissionon average, across taxpayers -of both permanent and transitory shocks to consumption, by 35 and 47 percent, respectively. By contrast, passive changes in tax policy and behavioral changes operated in the opposite direction, sometimes more than undoing this increase. 3 These findings reveal that decomposing into three distinctive parts the mechanism by which the tax system affects the transmission of income shocks to consumption is critical in order to adequately quantify the impact of tax policy changes. In particular, without the decomposition, researchers might have erroneously estimated that tax policy did not affect the transmission of income shocks to consumption, or that the insurance provided by the tax system did not change.",

Differences in magnitudes and non-monotonic differences, however, highlight the fact that tax policy has had a heterogeneous impact across the population and has contributed to increasing consumption inequality. In particular, the bottom income quartile and the least-educated groups are the only groups for which the transmission of permanent income shocks has hardly decreased over time, and their transmission is significantly larger than the other groups. Meanwhile, the transmission of transitory income shocks has increased proportionately more for the bottom and top income quartiles. We also find noticeable differences in the role of tax policy on different socioeconomic groups.

Alternatively, Kopczuk et al. (2010) use US Social Security income data and a non-parametric method, and find permanent income shocks are an essential part of the increase in inequality. 5 Most studies that evaluate the evolution of income shocks over time focus either on male earnings or household income (see Appendix A.7 for a discussion). We focus on household income because it is likely to reflect household consumption and welfare more broadly. 3 Our evidence on the effect of behavioral changes is consistent with Domar and Musgrave (1944) , who showed that although the income tax provides insurance, individuals may respond by taking on additional risk in ways that increase the variance of after-tax income. 4 More flexible models allow some consumers to be liquidity-constrained, other economic and policy changes (such as skill-biased technological change, labor unions, or minimum wages), and other types of shocks (such as unemployment, which is more likely to affect less-educated groups). These models also imply that consumers experience substantial responses to permanent income shocks, and that permanent increases or decreases in taxes should result in proportional consumption responses (Carroll, 2009; Violante, 2002) . 5 Debacker et al. (2013) find that the model-based approaches attribute more weight to transitory shocks than non-parametric methods.",

The fact that the increase in consumption inequality is smoother than that of income suggests that individuals can predict and insure against at least part of their income shocks (Cutler and Katz, 1992; Altonji and Siow, 1987; Attanasio and Weber, 1995; Aguiar and Bils, 2015; Attanasio and Pavoni, 2011; Attanasio et al., 2014) . Moffitt and Gottschalk (2012) and Heathcote et al. (2010) find that the overall increasing trend in consumption inequality is generally smaller than that of income inequality, because a component of these income shocks is transitory and insurable. 6 To better understand the transmission of income shocks to consumption, Blundell et al. (2008) directly estimate the size of the transmission of permanent and transitory income shocks to consumption. To do this, they construct a panel of individual consumption and income from the PSID and the CEX from the early 1980s to the early 1990s. Kaplan and Violante (2010) generalize the methods in Blundell et al. (2008) within a standard incomplete-markets model. Using simulated panel data, they show that when consumers are constrained in their borrowing, the transmission of income shocks to consumption could be lower than those in Blundell et al. (2008) . 7 Kaplan and Violante (2010) also show that one way to reduce this type of bias is to modify the model to include a mean-reverting shock with auto-correlation around 0.95 for the permanent component.

For example, Heathcote et al. (2010) and Debacker et al. (2013) find that the variability in after-tax income shocks is at least 15 percent smoother than before-tax income. However, this literature typically finds that the transmission of income shocks to consumption did not change over time (Blundell et al., 2008) . 8 This finding, however, is inconsistent with a public finance literature that finds that changes in the federal income tax have lowered the amount of insurance households have against income shocks (Auerbach and Feenberg, 2000; Pechman, 1973; Bargain et al., 2015) . We combine the micro-simulations typical of this public finance literature with a standard incomplete-markets macro-labor model to try and reconcile these findings.",

With these estimates, we can then decompose the changes in transmission and evaluate the contribution of different types of changes in the federal income tax system -either due to changes in the tax code (active tax changes) or to changes in income distribution (passive tax changes). We start from a standard life-cycle consumption-smoothing model that describes the relationship between consumption and income shocks. Next, we derive a set of moment conditions implied by the model, adapted to the specific nature of our panel data.

Households are subject to an inter-temporal budget 6 The macroeconomic literature has extensively studied the transmission of income shocks to consumption, with particular attention to the validity of the permanent income hypothesis (PIH), as opposed to other models of buffer-stock savings, impatient consumers, or models with liquidity constraints (Zeldes, 1989; Carroll and Kimball, 2001) . While the PIH implies that forward-looking consumers fully adjust consumption in response to permanent shocks and unconstrained consumers also fully insure transitory shocks, impatient or constrained consumers are subject to both permanent and transitory income shocks. Carroll (2009) applies various models of consumers' behavior under constraints to PSID data and finds that, although the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income shocks is always less than one, the PIH is approximately right: across a wide range of assumptions on the degree of impatience, marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income shocks is between 0.75 and 0.92. 7 and suggest that borrowing constrained and liquidity-constrained consumers are an important feature of the data. 8 Blundell et al. (2008) find little evidence that the level of transmission varied over their sample years, 1980-1992. Instead, they suggest that the increase in consumption smoothing in the late 1980s and early 1990s was due to increases in transitory shocks, which are transmitted to consumption less. 9 We recognize that excluding unstable households and single-parent families limits the scope of our analysis, especially insofar as these families are arguably more likely both to experience income shocks and to be targeted by policy insurance programs. However, as in Blundell et al. (2008) , we aim to abstract away from income shocks due to changes in family composition -such as divorce, widowhood, or separation -to pinpoint economic income shocks. As our main focus is to evaluate the evolution of fiscal policy stabilizers and their contribution to insurance, isolating market shocks is a critical first step. Section 4 discusses the limited impact that abstracting away from changes in family composition has on our findings.",

We also allow for those characteristics to vary across groups based on education, age, income, and cohorts by including group fixed effects. 11 We also follow Kaplan and Violante (2010) and loosen the no-foresight and short-memory assumptions implicit in Blundell et al. (2008) , see Table A .9. 12 Many empirical studies show that this is an accurate representation of the income process (MaCurdy, 1982; Abowd and Card, 1989; Moffitt and Gottschalk, 2011; Meghir and Pistaferri, 2004) . Carroll (2009) and Blundell and Pistaferri (2003) show evidence that simulations of equation (3) based on reasonable values accurately reproduce the income process in the PSID. 13 As in Blundell et al. (2008) , we provide results using alternative measures of income, including males' labor earnings. 14 We test the sensitivity of the estimates to the labor supply elasticity by using an elasticity of 0.1 and 0.4 as well. See Burtless and Hausman (1978) for exposition of the quasi-linear utility function. 15 This tractable equation can be derived from the Taylor expansion of the Euler equation of a CRRA utility function, with the derivation given in Appendix B.

These years correspond to the years before, during, and after most studies, and they roughly correspond to two different tax regimes as shown in Fig. 1 . Our findings are not sensitive to the grouping of years. 17 Traditional life-cycle models with forward-looking consumers imply that the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income shocks should be equal to one. However, extensive macro-economic and micro-economic empirical literature has shown evidence of excess smoothness or excess sensitivity in consumption response to predicted income shocks.

From 1968 to 2010, there were 55 federal tax changes beginning with the Revenue Act of 1971 and ending with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009. Appendix A.2 provides a deeper discussion of the federal income tax and lists these changes. One of the largest changes was the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This tax act was a sweeping change designed to simplify the tax code and broaden the base. Some of the key aspects include (i) lowering the top tax rate on individuals from 50% to 33%, (ii) consolidating the 15 tax brackets to 4, and (iii) expanding the standard deduction, personal exemption, and earned income tax credit. We simulate how these changesand all of the other tax changes -impact the amount of insurance the federal income tax provides to individuals by holding the income distribution fixed and allowing these changes to occur. How it ultimately affects the transmission of income shocks to consumption requires combining this simulation with the macro-labor model described in section 3.1.",

This shift causes individuals to interact more with higher tax brackets. If the upper part of the tax schedule is more progressive and income shifts in a way that cause more people to be in that range, then the federal income tax will, in general, provide people with more insurance. We simulate this channel holding the income tax schedule fixed and calculating how incomes would have changed in the absence of the income tax changes. Again, how this insurance affects the transmission of income shocks to consumption, and ultimately household welfare, requires the macro-labor model described in section 3.1.",

Tax bracket indexation was introduced as part of the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981 to end bracket creep, and went into effect in 1985. The results are robust to not indexing income. For more information on indexing in the federal income tax system, see Gillingham and Greenlees (1990) . 25 Butrica and Burkhauser (1997) provide a methodology for calculating tax liability based on TaxSim and PSID data. Auerbach and Feenberg (2000) and Pechman (1973) pioneered the use of TaxSim to isolate the effects of controlled income and policy shocks in the United States. Dolls et al. (2012) use Euromod, a similar tax simulation software, and TaxSim to isolate the effect of income and unemployment shocks on disposable income, and to compare the stabilization effect of fiscal policy in the United States and Europe over time. 26 We impute income in 1980 for households that do not report income that year. Although we chose 1980, which falls in the middle of the periods covered in our data, we also use 1995 and 2010 as alternative base years for income distribution and find that it does not affect the implications of our results. 27 Figure A .9 compares the active changes in insurance when using the observed distribution or a fixed 10% shock.",

While labor supply responses to taxes are important, their inclusion does not substantially change the estimate of passive insurance changes, likely because other changes in the income distribution are large during this period. In addition, in Appendix Table A .9 and Figure A .11, we compare the estimates of the transmission of income shocks using labor supply to taxes of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 to estimate passive insurance changes. This figure reveals there are only slight differences between estimated insurance parameters. In Section 5.2.2. and Appendix Table A .9, we also report and discuss estimates from a model that relaxes the assumption of no-foresight in the permanent component of income. Together this analysis supports that our computation of passive tax policy changes essentially captures the effect of changes in the income distribution.

Even among low-income households, we do not think that this is an important limitation since, for example, the percentage of single and joint households receiving the EITC are similar. 30 Within this sample, we exclude households with missing values on important socio-demographic variables, changes in headship, and income outliers defined as households with income growth above 500 percent, below -80 percent, or with a level of income below $100 in a given year (excluding 25.7 percent of the remaining sample). Finally, within this sample, we focus on household heads ages 30-65 and create 12 cohorts, each defined as being born in a given half-decade starting in 1920 and ending in 1979 (eliminating 37 percent of the remaining sample). Overall, starting with 264,810 observations, the final sample is composed of 19,493 observations (7.4 percent). This sample selection is followed in the CEX.

The regression is estimated with CEX data. Ziliak and Kniesner (2005) and Ziliak (1998) impute consumption on the basis of income and the first difference of wealth (defined as the difference between income and savings obtained from the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances). 29 Additional details are provided in appendix table A.4. These steps exclude families that report changes in headship and family composition or marital status. Also, the PSID public files do not report marital status from 1993-1996. To account for this, individuals are assigned the marital status they had in 1992 and 1997, if these two years have the same values, and are dropped otherwise. This restriction also limits the changes due to differences in education and retirement. 30 This sample selection also makes our paper comparable to previous studies that impute consumption from the PSID (Blundell et al., 2008) . We recognize that certain tax and non-tax benefits, such as the EITC, have largely benefited low-income single households. For instance, in 2003, 76 percent of EITC recipients were single-headed households. Yet, within low-income groups, the proportion of single and joint households receiving the EITC are similar. For instance, in 2003, about 0.02 percent of both single-headed and joint households with less than $40,000 of AGI received the EITC (authors' calculations using data from the Joint Committee on Taxation and SOI/IRS tax statistics). We define income groups based on 1980 income distribution, implying that intergenerational mobility likely moved low-income families in and out of the EITC over the period. sumption is constructed as the sum of food, alcohol, tobacco, services, heating fuel, public and private transport (including gasoline), personal care, clothing, and footwear, as proposed by Attanasio and Weber (1995) . 32 We start with pooled cross-sectional data from the CEX in 1972 and 1973, and from 1980 to 2010, and the following demand equation (following Blundell et al.

Fig. 2 shows that over time, imputed measures of average non-durable consumption (in logs) are close to our measure of PSID consumption, as well as 32 Although our baseline measure of consumption is non-durable consumption, we also consider three broader measures that alternatively include semidurables, services from durable goods, or both, with details provided in Appendix A.3 to test the robustness of the imputation and our findings. Consumers also use durable goods to smooth non-durable consumption, implying that total consumption including durables is more volatile over the life cycle. Yet, if the imputation method and the model are correct, our estimates of the impact of tax policy on insurance should not be affected by the inclusion of durable goods. 33 Consumption variables from 1999 include healthcare expenses (e.g. hospital, doctor, and prescription expenses), housing expenses (e.g. mortgage payments, rent, property taxes, and homeowner's insurance), utilities, vehicle expenses (e.g. loan payments, down payments, repairs, car insurance, and gasoline costs), transportation expenses (e.g. taxi, bus, and train), education expenses, and adult care expenses.

Second, when we modify the model to account for labor supply responses to taxes and other factors in Kaplan and Violante (2010) , we find smaller transmission coefficients of permanent income shocks.

Seegert Review of Economic Dynamics Section 5.1 begins with estimates of the variance of permanent and transitory income from 1968 to 2010 using Blundell et al. (2008) 's method. These estimates provide the context for the transmission coefficients. Next, Section 5.2 extends our analysis of the transmission coefficients over time, with varying identifying assumptions, including the more flexible approach in Kaplan and Violante (2010) , by sub-periods, and across income and education subgroups. These estimates provide a fuller picture of how the transmission coefficients have changed from 1968 to 2010. Finally, Section 5.3 reports estimates of the decomposition of the changes in the transmission coefficients into changes due to active tax changes, passive tax changes, and behavioral changes. We again consider how these contributions differ by income quartile and education attainment. Taken together, this set of estimates extends our understanding of how tax policy affects household welfare. Fig. 3 reports the variance of permanent and transitory income shocks. These shocks are estimated with the minimum distance estimation method and moment conditions described in Section 3 allowing for labor-supply responses to taxes and using the data on income and consumption described in Section 4. This figure reveals two key findings. First, from 1970 to the mid-1990s, the variance of permanent income shocks (dotted line) remains relatively flat, while the variance of transitory income shocks (solid line) follows an increasing trend. 35 Second, the variance of permanent income shocks increases from the late 1990s through 2010, while the variance of transitory income shocks decreases from its peak in the early 1990s through 2010. 36 Without extending the moment conditions to include two-year differences, it would have been impossible to detect the increase (decrease) in the variance of permanent (transitory) income shocks beyond the early 1990s. Figure A. 10 demonstrates that allowing for labor-supply responses to taxes increases the estimates of the variance of permanent and transitory income shocks. The trends, however, are very similar with and without labor-supply responses.",

The most general situation is for income shocks to be partially transmitted, which occurs when the coefficients lie between the two extremes. The smaller the coefficients, the lower the transmission of income shocks, and the higher the amount of insurance. We report the results using three methods that rely on different identifying assumptions and different sub-periods from 1968 to 2010. First, we estimate the transmission coefficients using the method in Blundell et al. (2008) , which we update using two-year moment conditions. We refer to this model as the BPP updated model. Second, we allow for persistent shocks using the method in Kaplan and Violante (2010) , and update it using two-year moment conditions. We refer to this model as the KV persistent model. Finally, we update the KV persistent model to allow for labor-supply responses to taxes, which we refer to as the KV persistent e 0.25 model.

Table 2 reports estimates in three periods : 1968-1978, 1979-1992, and 1993-2010 -a period before and after the period Blundell et al. (2008 ) studied. Our estimates in 1979 -1992 are similar to those in their paper. Column 1 reports the permanent transmission coefficient in Blundell et al. (2008) is 0.642 compared to our estimate of 0.661 reported in Column 2, which shows our estimates using their method, updated to incorporate additional two-year moment conditions. Using a longer period, however, our estimates reveal that the transmission of permanent income shocks was significantly higher during 1979-1992 than either before or after. In particular, we find that over the whole period and using the same model as in Blundell et al. (2008) , the average permanent transmission coefficient is 0.527, and decreased substantially from the period 1979-1992 to the last period. This evidence suggests that the insurance to permanent income shocks is larger than previously suggested, and has increased in recent years. Columns 3 and 4 report the estimates using the methodology in Kaplan and Violante (2010) , showing a similar trend. We investigate the differences between models in the next section. Fig. 4 provides a more detailed picture of how the estimated transmission coefficients vary over periods, by depicting permanent and transitory transmission coefficients in Panels A and B, respectively. From 1968 to 2010, the permanent transmission coefficient decreases from roughly 0.5 to 0.1, suggesting that consumers have become better insulated from permanent income shocks recently than they were 40 years ago. This result is consistent across methods. This finding, that consumption insurance of permanent shocks increased, seems at odds with how tax policy has changed. Indeed, the microsimulations shown in Fig. 1 revealed that insurance from the federal income tax moved in the opposite direction, decreasing the amount of income insurance overall, or increasing the transmission of permanent income shocks from pre-to post-tax incomes. To reconcile these two pieces of evidence, it is necessary to decompose the changes in transmission coefficients into different types of tax policy changes, which we do in Section 5.3.",

This, however, hides that the transitory transmission coefficient has increased over time. Using a longer period, we find that in the 1970s, households were almost entirely insulated from transitory income shocks. Since then, the transmission coefficient has increased, reaching levels of around 0.2 after 1992 on average, up to around 0.4 in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Fig. 4) .

(2008) . This difference in estimates across the two models is consistent with the findings in Kaplan and Violante (2010) . 38 Though the overall trends are similar across the two methods, their variations differ in several places. Specifically, for the permanent transmission coefficients, their variations upward or downward tend to differ in the 1980s and 1990s, making the methods diverge, even though they move along the same trends. Then, they move back together in the late 1990s and after. In contrast, for the transitory transmission coefficients, the estimates only start to diverge in the 1990s and 2000s.",

            "text": "The divergence in estimates across models is likely due to a combination of the model assumptions about liquidity constraints and tax policy changes. Kaplan and Violante (2010) show that because the model in Blundell et al. (2008) precludes the existence of liquidity-constrained consumers, their model overestimates the transmission of permanent income shocks. One of the largest changes in consumer liquidity constraints occurred as a result of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Ryan et al., 2011) . Specifically, the act limited interest deductions for individuals from all personal loans -including credit cardsto only interest deductions on mortgages. In response, consumers became more leveraged in relatively non-liquid assets. While certainly not definitive, the timing of this change in consumer liquidity constraints is consistent with the timing of the divergence of the transmission coefficient estimates across models. 39 Therefore, in Table 3 and from now on, we present the estimates over two sub-periods -1968-1985 and 1986-2010 -to correspond with the periods before and after the Tax Reform Act of 1986. We have shown already how this reform caused a notable change to insurance in the micro-simulations depicted in Fig. 1 , and here we can see how the differences between the Blundell et al. (2008) and Kaplan and Violante (2010) models diverge further after this reform regarding the transmission of permanent income shocks. 37 Panels A and B of Table 3 provide the average permanent and transitory transmission coefficients, respectively, over the full period 1968-2010 and the two sub-periods. 38 In particular, Kaplan and Violante (2010) say that their generalization of the model in Blundell et al. (2008) show that \"the actual insurability of shocks in the US economy may be higher than what was measured by BPP.\" 39 Kaplan and Violante (2010) also explore the implications of information by relaxing assumptions about no foresight and short memory. We also consider these changes to the model. Unfortunately, we are unable to relax these assumptions and use two-year differences, which are necessary to use years after 1996, for the transitory transmission coefficients. We report the estimates for the permanent transmission coefficient, however, in Figure A .11 and Table  A .9.",

These estimates suggest that consumers adjust their choices relative to productivity to smooth their consumption. In particular, the estimates of the permanent transmission coefficient shown in Columns (2) and (3) of Panel A of Table 3 decrease from 0.277 to 0.264 over the entire sample when the method allows for labor-supply responses. The difference is similar in the first and second sub-periods. In contrast, the transitory transmission coefficients are slightly larger using the model that allows for labor-supply responses to taxes. The estimates increase from 0.038 to 0.043 (reported in Columns 2 and 3 of Panel B). Figure A.11 and Table A .9 consider other values for the elasticity of labor supply. The differences in the estimates of transmission coefficients across elasticities are relatively small, and tend to be slightly smaller for larger labor-supply elasticities. In particular, the permanent and transitory transmission coefficients decrease to 0.272 and 0.058 respectively, for an elasticity of 0.1, to 0.257 and 0.045 respectively. for an elasticity of 0.4.",

In particular, Panel A of Table 4 reports that the average permanent transmission coefficient is 0.538 for the bottom income quartile (Column 1) and 0.233 for the top income quartile (Column 4). Similarly, the average permanent transmission coefficient is 0.359 for high-school graduates (Column 5) and 0.220 for individuals with at least some college education (Column 6). The smaller permanent transmission coefficients for high-income quartiles likely reflect these groups' ability to smooth through credit, savings, and interacting with the federal income tax schedule in a different place.

The trends in the permanent transmission coefficient are similar across income and education groups, decreasing for all subgroups from 1968 to 2010. The magnitudes, however, differ somewhat across groups. For example, the middle income quartiles and those with some college education experienced larger decreases than the other income quartiles and educational attainment levels.",

As the progressive income tax and transfer system plays a key role in reducing inequality, we focus on the role of the federal income tax as a key mechanism behind changes in the transmission of income shocks. Because high-income people pay higher average tax rates than others, federal taxes reduce inequality. Previous studies have provided suggestive evidence of this mechanism by comparing differences in the variance of pre-tax and post-tax income (Debacker et al., 2013) . 41 Evidence shows that before-tax income inequality has risen since the 1970s, despite an increase in government transfers, but that the mitigating effect of taxes on inequality is about the same today as before 1980. Thus, after-tax income inequality has increased about as much as before-tax inequality. 42 We use consumption as a more accurate and complete measure of economic well-being than after-tax income. How much the federal income tax affects consumption smoothing, however, is an open question. The ability of the federal income tax to smooth consumption has been called into question, in part because despite the fact that changes in active federal income tax policy have provided less insurance to householdsas evidenced in the micro-simulations in Section 3.3.1 -macro-labor models have shown that the transmission of income shocks has stayed the same or decreased.",

These three channels could operate in opposite directions, which could effectively mask their individual contributions. Specifically, we observe a decrease in the permanent transmission coefficient of 0.246 over the sample period (Table 5 , Panel A, Column 3, bottom row). This decrease, however, is a net change. For example, it could be the result of passive tax policy only, with no effect from active tax policy changes or behavioral changes. It could also be the combined result of changes in active tax policy that increases the parameter by 0.4 and of passive changes that decreased it by 0.646, with no impact from behavioral responses. In sum, to understand how federal income tax policy changes impacted households' consumption smoothing, it is necessary to decompose tax policy changes into passive and active changes and estimate their specific contribution to the transmission coefficients. Table 5 reports the contribution of active tax policy changes, passive tax policy changes, and behavioral changes to the permanent and transitory transmission coefficients, in Panels A and B, respectively. Column (1) reports the estimates for the BPP updated model. Columns (2) and (3) report the estimates of the KV persistent and KV persistent e 0.25 model.

We find the opposite for transitory income shocks: while the transmission of transitory income shocks to consumption was small a few decades ago, consumers have become less insured to transitory income shocks in recent years. Though the trends are similar across socio-economic groups, low income and less educated taxpayers still experience significantly less insurance to permanent income shocks than any other group. Meanwhile, the transmission of transitory income shocks has increased proportionately more for both the bottom-and top-income groups. This suggests increased inequality in the transmission of income shocks to consumption.",

We define changes in the tax code, such as changes in tax rates or subsidies or changes in tax design, as active tax policy changes. We define changes due to exogenous changes in the income distribution and how these changes interact with the non-linear income tax schedule as passive tax policy changes. Finally, we define changes in the difference between pre-and post-tax incomes that are not due to active or passive tax policy as behavioral responses, such as aversion to risk or private insurance. This decomposition allows us to not only uncover the overall role of the tax system to change the insurance of final consumption, but also separate and evaluate the different mechanisms by which tax policy operates.",

Behavioral tax policy changes, or consumers' responses to active and passive tax policy changes, have decelerated the transmission of both income shocks, sometimes enough to offset the accelerating trend of active tax policy changes. The contribution of active tax policy to reduce the insurance to permanent income shocks is not significantly different across income groups, but active tax policy reduced the insurance to transitory income shocks significantly more for the bottom-and the top-income groups. Nevertheless, for the top-income group, insurance to transitory income shocks was mostly offset by behavioral responses that increased insurance, while for the lowest income group, behavioral tax policy changes reinforced further the reduction in insurance to transitory shocks.",
