With effective vaccines almost available, it is appropriate at this time to have some reflections about COVID-19 in relation to the quality of life issues. In this paper, we highlight twelve issues for reflection, which can help us better prepared for future pandemics. These include: digital divide, health inequality, gender inequality, economic disadvantage, family well-being, impact on holistic well-being, economic development versus saving lives, consumption versus environmental protection, individual rights versus collective rights, international collaboration versus conflict, prevention of negative well-being, and promotion of positive well-being.",

According to Johns Hopkins University, the number of infected cases is more than 65 million in early December 2020. With its sudden onset, highly contagious nature and widespread prolonged negative impact around the globe, governments, policy-makers, medical and allied professional as well as the general public have concentrated efforts to \"put out the fire\". With the occurrence of different pandemic waves in different societies in the past year, there is not much time and space for reflections, particularly with reference to the different aspects of quality of life. In recent months, there is some good news that effective vaccines may be available soon, although the existence of effective vaccines does not mean that the problems can be resolved overnight. Hence, it is timely to have reflections about the impact of COVID-19 on quality of life so that we will be better prepared for the pandemic in the future. Examples from Hong Kong are highlighted for reflection.",

Certainly, the efficiency of such activities depends very much on computer capability and smoothness of Internet connection, particularly for families in the rural area (Lai and Widmar 2020) . For students, online teaching and learning has become the major form of education because of school lockdown. There are several advantages of online teaching and learning. First, teaching and learning mode is more flexible. Students can revisit the materials at times when they are convenient. Second, online pedagogies such as videos, virtual reality, games, and experiential learning activities are welcomed by young people who prefer to have active learning. Third, teaching and learning through online teaching can motivate and engage students. On the other hand, online teaching also creates several problems for students. First, if a student does not have a fast computer, online learning is a painful process. In Hong Kong, some students from poor families simply use the cell phones of the parents for learning, which creates health problems (such as eyesight and exercise problems) for them. Second, online learning depends on the availability of WIFI connection, which further depends on the financial resource of the family. Again, weak WIFI connection is a nightmare for online learning. Third, if students have more than one sibling in a family, there will be competition for computer use and WIFI data. If the parents also work from home, the competition would be even tougher. Finally, online learning reduces peer support and teacher guidance, which can typically be received during recess or lunchtime during normal school days. In a recent study, 43% of the teachers pointed out that there are communication and participation issues of online learning under COVID-19 (Stelitano et al. 2020) .",

In Hong Kong, some mothers from mainland China expressed the worry that they did not understand how to use laptops, such as downloading worksheets from online learning systems such as ZOOM. Empirically, phenomena on gender inequalities occur during COVID-19. Based on data collected from the United States, Germany, and Singapore, Reichelt et al.

Power (2020) also pointed out that the invisible and unpaid care work of women increased under COVID-19. In the research area, Pinho-Gomes et al.

Although the Government has launched two rounds of job support schemes in Hong Kong, many workers have been forced to take no-pay leave. For some airline industries in Hong Kong such as Cathy Pacific and Dragon Air, massive layoffs happened which lead to unemployment problem. Psychologically, unemployment creates increased stress and mental health problems for unemployed persons. Such problems will spill over to marital quality, which would further adversely affect family processes such as parenting and family functioning processes. For communities with a large number of low-income families, community cohesion is typically not high, and there are many social problems such as crime and health issues. Hence, minimizing poverty arising from COVID-19 is an important policy priority. While many countries have job support schemes, the difficulty is that the duration cannot be too long due to constraints in economic resources. Relevant services supporting unemployed people and their families should also be considered. Sumner et al. (2020) estimated the impact of COVID-19 on poverty indexed by per capita household income and consumption and concluded that COVID-19 could increase global poverty and constitute obstacles to attaining the goal of eliminating poverty by 2030. Assuming consumption contraction of 20%, they also estimated an increase of 420-580 million poor people compared to the 2018 figures. Buheji et al. (2020) also remarked that COVID-19 is a \"new source\" of poverty that has a negative economic impact on developed and under-developed economies. As such, Pak et al. (2020) argued for the \"epidemic preparedness\" concerning the economic consequences of pandemic.",

While this may promote family cohesion and provide more opportunities for interaction amongst the family members, staying at the family may pose at least two challenges. First, if family members have different views, prolonged stay in the family would create more conflicts. For example, staying at home during COVID-19 in Hong Kong creates additional conflicts for family members because parents and their children may hold different political views about the Social Event taking place in 2019-2020 (Shek 2020b) . Besides, if the space in the family is small, staying at home means less personal space for each family member, and they also compete for family resources such as WIFI data and space.

As such, public attention has been placed more on the numbers of infected cases and death tolls as well as physical health complications arising from the disease. While it is crucial to focus on the physical well-being consequences of COVID-19, looking at other aspects of well-being under COVID-19 is equally important. In the medical and allied professionals, it is commonly argued that there are four domains of health, including physical, psychological, social, and spiritual domains. Besides the physical consequences of COVID-19, we need to understand the psychological consequences of the pandemic, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorders. Most importantly, it is vital to understand how different psychological resources such as adversity quotient (AQ), emotional quotient (EQ), and coping resources may help individuals cope with stress arising from COVID-19. Unfortunately, the focus on the non-physical aspect of well-being is not strong in many places, including Hong Kong.",

Hence, how to maintain family health and promote family resilience is an important question to be addressed. One argument we should consider is that the promotion of family social capital is an attractive option for the family with a reduction in the financial capital of the family under COVID-19. Second, with city lockdown, social interaction drops. As social support is a protective factor of adversity, reduction in social interaction is a threat. Undoubtedly, with Internet technology, it is possible to maintain social contact with others. However, Internet technology may be a challenge for old people who are commonly unfamiliar with the latest Internet technology. In Hong Kong, many aged people are still using 3G cell phones. The same social wellbeing challenge exists for young people. During school lockdown, young people can only count on online interaction with others. While some may over-use such mechanisms, others may feel lonely if they have difficulty in WIFI connection. Finally, relative to studies on physical well-being, comparatively fewer studies have been conducted to examine spiritual well-being under COVID-19. Focus on spiritual wellbeing is essential for two reasons. First, finding meaning in suffering under COVID-19 is vital. Second, spiritual resources such as seeking help from God and having positive beliefs about resilience (such as positive cultural beliefs about adversity) are important for positive coping.",

As economic growth is a key performance indicator of a government and many small and medium-sized businesses will die with prolonged shutting of the economic engine, there is a cry for restarting the economic engine by governments. For example, Donald Trump indicated his wish to restart the economy after Easter 2020. In some European countries in summer 2020, officials devised plans to save the tourism and hotel industries when the number of infected cases decreased. On the other hand, there are views cautioning restarting the economy prematurely, which will increase the death toll and the number of infected cases.

The first question is whether it is necessary to have so much air travel related to business and pleasure. With COVID-19, many business meetings are going online. Similarly, people begin to realize that they can live happily (or at least healthily) without taking trips via air travel. The second question is whether there is a need to change our lifestyle, such as reducing unnecessary consumption. We must ask ourselves two questions: a) do we need to consume so much? b) can we enjoy well-being without excessive material consumption? Under Capitalism, consumption is the driver for economic growth, creating \"wealth\" for people. Also, consumption is encouraged under Capitalism because it helps to maintain the circular flow of income. However, it is time to reflect upon the price we have to pay for endless economic activities and explore whether there are more environmentally friendly options.",

For example, Toebes (2020) pointed out there was tension between individual rights and public health and whether government measures would compromise human rights and personal privacy. Regarding the proposal to wear masks, scientific findings show the preventive role of wearing facial masks (Li et al. 2020) , and wearing masks can be regarded as a sign of altruism which can promote social solidarity (Cheng et al. 2020 ). However, some people do not follow the policy of wearing facial masks because they believe this is an infringement of the individual right. One interesting observation is that while many countries and places have a policy of requiring people to wear masks in public places, resistance to such a policy is much stronger in Western societies than in Asian societies.",

            "text": "Faced with the global pandemic, it is reasonable to encourage international collaboration. However, there is politics in international collaboration (McKenzie 2020), as shown by the occurrence of several unfortunate events. First, blaming the victim formed the international discourse in the first few months. Although people in Wuhan suffered from the pandemic, they were blamed for spreading the virus. Political figures in several countries claimed that COVID-19 is a \"Chinese virus\" and they even demanded compensation. With reference to available scientific findings, scientists have clearly pointed out that there is no concrete conclusion on the origin of COVID-19, and traces of coronavirus were found in a sewage sample in Spain in March 2019. Second, although the World Health Organization has tried its absolute best to cope with the pandemic, it was criticized heavily for the \"slow\" response and not making impartial responses. Third, different countries and societies tend to develop their own measures to cope with the pandemic without much international concerted efforts. Susskind and Brown (2020) argued that infectious diseases control such as COVID-19 should be treated as \"global public goods\", and international cooperation is key to the successful implementation of the related tasks. Fry et al. (2020) pointed out that smaller teams, narrowed membership, elitism and fewer societies were involved in COVID-19 research compared to pre-COVID research in coronavirus. Considering the high failure rate of development COVID-19 research, Zhou (2020) argued for the stepping up of effort for international collaboration involving different stakeholders should be promoted. Finally, Basrur and Kliem (2020) argued that while different approaches offer insights on international cooperation, the realistic perspective highlighting national interests over collective effort is a useful tool to understand international collaboration.",

From the public health perspective, there are at least two strategies one should adopt Shek 2020a ). The first strategy is minimization of risk factors associated with the negative impacts of COVID-19, such as helping disadvantaged areas with less-developed medical services and social groups with inadequate health education. The second strategy is to strengthen factors that can protect people under COVID-19 (i.e., protective factors). With particular reference to young people, findings support the importance of developmental assets in promoting well-being in young people, such as resilience, emotional competence, spirituality, and self-efficacy (Ma et al. 2019; Shek and Zhu 2020; Zhu and Shek 2020) . It is suggested that validated positive youth development programs, particularly those nurturing life skills in young people , would help young people cope with adversity. Apparently, having prevention initiatives before the pandemic would better prepare people for the trauma associated with the pandemic, and such initiatives can save lives.",

Although there are different answers based on different theories, several factors contribute to positive quality of life. First, an accurate understanding of COVID-19 and how to prevent it (such as maintenance of personal hygiene) can reduce the perceived stress surrounding COVID-19. Second, maintaining hope is always a key factor under adversity. One way is to look at the bright side of the pandemic (there must be some). Third, maintaining social contact provides support and assistance under the pandemic, particularly social capital generated within the family context. Fourth, finding the meaning of suffering under COVID-19 is helpful because purpose shapes attitude to the pandemic and coping repertoires. Fifth, instead of over-criticizing the governments for their inability to stop the pandemic, showing appreciation of the work done by government officials, medical and allied professionals, teachers teaching online, volunteers, and the general public who adhere to the health restriction measures can help to generate a positive community culture. Learning how to be grateful to those who have served under COVID-19 is also important. Sixth, empowerment for oneself, peers, family, community, and society levels is helpful. Finally, having a resilient mindset (i.e., regarding pandemic as a chance for growth and development), embracing the challenges and treating them as opportunities to grow (Yamaguchi et al. 2020 ) can help to promote positive well-being under COVID-19.",
