            "text": "Sweden stands out among the other European countries by the degree of restrictive measures taken towards handling the 2019 coronavirus outbreak, associated with the CoViD-19 pandemic. While several governments have imposed a nationwide total or partial lockdown in order to slow down the spread of the virus, the Swedish government has opted for a recommendation-based approach together with a few imposed restrictions. In the present contribution, the impact of this strategy will be observed through the monitored variation of the city noise levels during the associated period. The data used are recorded during a campaign of over a full year of noise level measurements at a building fa\u00e7ade situated in a busy urban intersection in central Stockholm, Sweden. The noise level reductions, observed during the period of restrictions, are shown to be comparable to those found for the two most popular public holidays in Sweden with a peak reduction occurring during the first half of April 2020. Contrary to what has been recently discussed in public media, the spread of the virus, the recommendations, and the restrictions imposed during the ongoing pandemic clearly have had a significant effect on the transport and other human-related activities in Stockholm. In this unique investigation, the use of distributed acoustic sensors has thus shown to be a viable solution not only to enforce regulations but also to monitor the effectiveness of their implementation.",

The rapid spread of the disease has led most govern-5 ments to implement social distancing laws or recommendations which restrict some of the human activities. The severity of these restrictions, e.g. including closedown, lockdown, closing borders, vary considerably across countries and many governments have introduced a dynamic response on whether to loosen, maintain, or tighten restrictions in relation to updated data on CoViD-19 cases 10 and fatality rates. The potential of such restrictions to address the rate at which the virus spreads, at a local scale, or internationally, has been given much attention in response to the urgency of the situation. For instance, travel restrictions have shown to substantially mitigate the spread of CoViD-19 [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

Lighter colors in the color scale highlight noisier locations, which places the chosen location among the noisiest in the neighbourhood. The location was specifically chosen due to the significant contribution from 100 multiple sources of noise associated with urban activity: at a traffic-signal controlled crossroad between two major axes for road traffic (dual lane segments), the measurement point is also in the direct vicinity of the entrance to a subway station, an important bus stop, and a high spot for dining and nightlife in Stockholm, some nearby locations being open until 4:00 AM. Altogether, 105 the noise levels recorded at this location may be considered as representative of human-activity in central Stockholm, including traffic from public transport, individuals and freight traffic, entertainment (cinemas, bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and nightclubs in the area), local residential life, etc. The noise levels were logged continuously at this location from the middle of April 2019, which pro-110 vides a good background basis for the evaluation of the impact associated with the reduced activity due to the emergence of CoViD-19 and the measures taken by the authorities. 3.

Note that the analysis includes the period following Christmas and New Years' celebrations, a very quiet period in Stockholm (in particular until the Epiphany, on January 6). The plot includes highlighted months in the transition to a slowdown of activities in Stockholm, i.e. March-May 2020, as 155 well as vertical lines corresponding to specific recommendations or restrictions announced by the Public Health Agency of Sweden (\"Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten\", or FoHM), including: Noise level fluctuation with respect to the long-time reference average, taking into account groupings according to weekdays and weekend patterns.\u2022 banned public gatherings of more than 500 people (announced on March 11, in effect from March 12, week 11) [19], 160 \u2022 a recommendation for anyone with symptoms of common cold to stay home (March 13, week 11) [20], \u2022 a recommendation for remote work in Stockholm (March 16, week 12) [21], \u2022 a recommendation for anyone aged over 70 years old to minimize physical interactions (March 16, week 12) [21], 165 \u2022 a recommendation for remote teaching at high schools and universities (March 17, week 12) [22],\u2022 gradual closing of universities and upper secondary schools to students (March 18, week 12), following the recommendation in Ref.[22],\u2022 a recommendation to avoid unnecessary travels (March 19, week 12) banned public gatherings of more than 50 people (March 27, week 13)[25].First, the months of January-February (weeks 1-9) highlight a clear gradual increase of activities following the Holiday season, resuming to close-to-normal 175 levels towards the end of January (e.g. week 5). Note that weeks 8 and 9 correspond to the winter holidays in the Stockholm-Uppsala area, which could to a degree explain the above-average levels observed on the weekends of weeks 7-9. The transition occurring in the first half of March is interesting to highlight, in particular when comparing the noise level reduction associated with the 180 weekdays or the weekends. During the period leading to the month of March, no consistent distinction may be made between the reduction in noise levels between weekdays or the weekend. A significant distinction may however be highlighted starting from the weekend of week 10, i.e. a few days before the implementation of the ban on public gatherings of more than 500 people[19].185 From that point onward in time, the noise levels on weekends start to drop substantially faster than the noise levels associated with weekdays (notice for instance the sharp drop on the weekend of week 11, first weekend after the implementation of this ban). These weekend levels suddenly drop in the course of the month of March to an average of \u22122.9 dB(A) 1 difference to the reference 190 averaged level, towards the end of the month and into the month of April, weeks 13 and 14. On the other hand, the weekday levels start to drop with a shift of about a week compared to these weekend levels. In particular, a sharp drop is observed in week 12 on the day immediately following the announcement of the recommendation by FoHM to implement remote work in Stockholm whenever 195 possible[21]. In that same week, and following a series of recommendations also concerning educational institutions[22], the level drop associated with weekdays reaches an average noise level reduction comparable to the one associated with weekend levels. Given the number of recommendations issued during this pivot week 12, averaged fluctuations are presented on a daily basis inFig. 3 for this 200week.From the last week of March onward, a consistently higher drop is observed on weekends than the one observed in connection with weekdays. This may reflect not only a slowdown of economical/work-related activities, but an even greater slowdown of entertainment-related activities, associated both with 205 tourists and Stockholmers. While the noise level drop stabilized on average around a \u22123 dB(A) 1 difference to the reference averaged level for weekends associated with weeks 13-16, this drop stabilized on average around a \u22121.9 dB(A) difference for the weekday levels. Note, as further highlighted in the following, that these level drops are comparable to the ones observed during the major 210 drop of urban activity associated with the peak of the holiday season. Starting in the second half of April, there seems to be a slow, gradual trend for the average levels to increase again, both those associated with the weekdays and the weekends. This may reflect a gradual pick up in human activities, made possible by the fact that most recommendations made from the authorities are 215 not strongly enforced. In particular, the last available average, corresponding to the first half of week 27, highlights the highest level observed for a weekday average for a period of 17 weeks. Nevertheless, the levels reached during these latest weeks available, in June 2020, are of the order of the levels during the period of low activity in January 2020, at least 1 dB(A) below the average 220 reference levels (especially for the weekend averages). Additionally, for the 12 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f entire period of presumed CoViD-19 effects, available at the time of the present contribution (Weeks 10-26), the weekend levels have remained on average about 1 dB(A) lower than the weekdays levels. This may highlight that self-imposed restrictions following the recommendations by the authorities, may have been 225 observed in good agreement with the ones taken for economical activities. This also partially confirms the observations made in Ref. [16] for the Scandinavian case, which led the authors to suggest that a major part of the slowdown in activities may be attributed to the spread of the virus itself (i.e. the reaction of the population to this spread) rather than the severity of the measures taken 230 by the authorities.3.3. Fluctuations on a longer time-perspective: analysis from April 2019 Considering a longer time perspective, from April 2019 to the end of June 2020, Fig. 4 illustrates similar noise level fluctuations, removing the distinction between weekdays and weekends. It consists in a day-to-day drop or increase 235 of the averaged noise level compared to an average level over the entire period (i.e. one average level per day of the week), together with a smoothed average of these variations (orange line). A 7-day rolling average, i.e. a simple equally weighted running mean over seven days, is used in this case, in line with the curve-smoothing approach used by FoHM for the presentation of its CoViD-240 19-related daily statistics. The months of March-May 2020 are highlighted as previously done in Fig. 3. The rolling average provides an overview of the trend of fluctuation over the entire period considered, while the daily fluctuations allow to capture peak fluctuations during this period. First, it is noteworthy that the rolling average shows relatively little fluc-245 tuation of the noise level in the entire period leading to December 2019, with average deviations of at most 1 dB(A) from the reference average during this 7-month period. A sharp average increase is then observed in the period lead-Fluctuations in noise levels shown with 1-day resolution and 7-day rolling average. ing to the Holiday season in December 2019, reaching up to about a 1.6 dB(A) average increase just before the Holiday season drop. The subsequent gradual 250 resuming of activities in January 2020 is then observed in agreement with the description associated with Fig. 3. Second, the two Public holidays of dominant importance in the Swedish culture, associated with the Midsummer (a major tradition, where Swedish citizens observe a return to rural traditions, commonly celebrated outside of major cities) and Christmas celebrations (typically spent 255 with family members at home), respectively on June 21 and December 24, are highlighted for the year 2019 as the quietest days, with single-day drops of about -2.4 dB(A) and -2.7 dB(A), respectively (and -2.4 dB(A) for December 25), in the average noise level compared to the reference level. Note that Midsummer 2020, on June 21, also experienced an expected substantial single-day drop, over 260 -3 dB(A) compared to the reference level, i.e. even quieter than the Midsummer celebration in 2019 (also reflected in the very quiet weekend of week 25 in",

Additionally, the gradual upward trend depicted by the rolling average from around mid-270 April 2020, seems to indicate a gradual pick up in human activities (confirmed in Fig. 3 both for weekdays and weekends), to a level in late June 2020 comparable to the period of low activity immediately following the Holiday season, in the beginning of January. 3.4. Changes in the intraday noise level patterns 275 Following the analysis of Figs. 3 and 4, highlighting the very clear impact of both the spread of the virus, and the associated measures announced by FoHM, details of the way intraday noise levels patterns were affected are presented here. Figs. 5 detail these patterns, averaged over several weeks, outside or during the peak period of CoViD-19-related effects: week 16 in 2019 to week 9 280 in 2020 for the reference period, and week 13 to week 18 in 2020 to highlight the effects of the spread of CoViD-19 and the associated mitigation measures. Weekday patterns or weekend-day patterns, in line with the distinction made in connection with Fig. 2, are plotted in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b, respectively. An overall observation is that all time segments of the day and night are 285 similarly impacted, reflecting a global slowdown of human-related activities. Focusing first on the weekday patterns, Fig. 5a highlights a fa\u00e7ade noise level reduced by 1.5-2 dB(A) during the day (07:00-18:00), 2-3 dB(A) during the evening (18:00-00:00), and by a broader range of 1-4 dB(A) in the sensitive segment comprising the rest of the night (00:00-05:30).

The morning period 07:30-09:00 highlights a typical smoother transition on weekend days from quiet nighttime to daytime noise levels.

This corresponds to a time segment where sidewalk cleaning trucks are working in 305 the area of measurement, occurring both on weekend days and weekdays. It is interesting to notice that this time segment is therefore almost not affected by the slowdown associated with CoViD-19. The exceedance of the associated peak, compared to otherwise measured levels, is in fact one confirmation of the stability of the measurement over the entire period of the campaign. 310 The comparison of the noise level reduction associated with the intraday patterns for weekdays and weekend days confirms the observation made from Fig. 3: the slowdown of activities during the peak period following the recommendations by the authorities was more severe during the weekend than during the week. This highlights the impact of the recommendations, the impact of the 315 awareness of the spread of the virus by the Stockholmers, and possibly, though outside the scope of this contribution, a partial reallocation of their activities",

This implies that conclusions about the absolute fluctuations of noise levels or activity are not as relevant as the relative fluctuations, hence the comparison with levels measured during the most popular public holidays, 330 which provide a reference for this qualitative assessment. As mentioned in the last statement of the previous subsection, this local analysis therefore does not reflect a systemic impact, being for instance insensitive to the potential reallocation of activities to less central or peri-urban areas, or their fluctuation to differing degrees. This would have to be addressed in a potential follow-up, 335 e.g. considering a mobility approach based on the availability of mobile phone data, as noise measurement data are not available at such a scale for the period covered in this contribution. Second, in connection with the availability of the data, the noise measurements for the chosen location are only available from April 2019, making the 340 comparison possible only from one year to the next. Although it would have been beneficial to extend the comparison to levels from earlier years as well, in order to rule out non-CoViD-19-related fluctuations from one year to the next, there are reasons to be confident that such potential fluctuations may have only marginally impacted the results, and thus not changed the conclusions. One 345 such reason is found in the great stability of the noise levels observed in the reference period in 2019, with fluctuations of the averaged levels limited to \u00b11 dBA compared to the mean value, until December 2019. The fluctuations associated with the spread of the virus and correlated with the recommendations greatly exceed these minor fluctuations, see Fig. 4. Furthermore, the levels reached in 350 early March 2020, just before the first recommendations by Swedish authorities, are exactly in the range of the earliest data available in 2019.The availability of data from a broader network of acoustic sensors, such as currently deployed in Stockholm, would have been most beneficial for a largerscale analysis. This may be enabled in a near future by taking measurements 355 from future years as reference levels for a similar assessment of the currently measured levels in other areas of the city, provided that the activities will return to pre-CoViD-19 conditions. This may be verified by making use of the data available for the present contribution, as the associated noise level monitoring is ongoing at the time of writing.",

The substantial and sustained 365 drop in noise levels observed from March 2020, attributed to the impact of the spread of CoViD-19, is analysed in relation to the associated recommendations made by the authorities in Sweden. A very strong correlation is in particular observed during the pivot week 12 of 2020, when the major recommendations and restrictions have been issued by FoHM. A peak drop of more than 4 dB(A) 370 is observed on the daily average, in April 2020, i.e. about a month after this pivot week: a stronger level drop than the ones observed for the two quietest, major Public holidays observed in Sweden. Although no strict lockdown has been enforced over that period in Sweden, these measurements indicate a rapid compliance of the Stockholmers to the issued recommendations leading to a 375 clear slowdown in urban activities. Despite a gradual pick up in these activities from around mid-April 2020, the levels observed in the beginning of June 2020, up to the week before the Midsummer celebrations (week 25), highlight levels in the range of those associated with the low activity following the Holiday season. On average, the levels for the first half of June 2020 are between 0.5 dB(A) and 380 2 dB(A) lower than the same period in 2019, but the trend observed seems to indicate a prompt return to normal levels, especially concerning weekdays. Finally, the analysis here presented of noise level fluctuations in a specifically targeted area of the inner city, highlights the interest of low-cost solutions for acoustic sensing in the context of Smart Cities, as a source of information about 385 urban life, e.g. in connection with regulations and their associated impact. Thepresent study is however limited to the heart of the inner city, and may be completed with a mobility study in order to evaluate the potential transfer of human urban activities to other locations (e.g. associated with public parks and beaches in or around the city, where a spread of the virus may also occur).",
