In an established isogenic murine model of glioblastoma, we discovered correlated transcriptome-wide sex differences in gene expression, H3K27ac marks, large Brd4bound enhancer usage, and Brd4 localization to Myc and p53 genomic binding sites. These sex-biased gene expression patterns were also evident in human glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). These observations led us to hypothesize that Brd4-bound enhancers might underlie sex differences in stem cell function and tumorigenicity in GBM. We found that male and female GBM cells exhibited opposing responses to pharmacological or genetic inhibition of Brd4. Brd4 knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition decreased male GBM cell clonogenicity and in vivo tumorigenesis, while increasing both in female GBM cells. These results were validated in male and female patient-derived GBM cell lines. Furthermore, analysis of the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal of human GBM samples segregated by sex revealed that male GBM cells are significantly more sensitive to BET inhibitors than are female cells. Thus, for the first time, Brd4 activity is revealed to drive a sex differences in stem cell and tumorigenic phenotype, resulting in diametrically opposite responses to BET inhibition in male and female GBM cells. This has important implications for the clinical evaluation and use of BET inhibitors.",

GBM, the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor, occurs with higher incidence and shorter survival in males compared to females. Brd4 is essential for regulating transcriptome-wide gene expression and specifying cell identity, including that of GBM. We report that sex-biased Brd4 activity drive sex differences in GBM and render male and female tumor cells differentially sensitive to BET inhibitors. The observed sex differences in BETi treatment strongly indicate that sex differences in disease biology translate into sex differences in therapeutic responses. This has critical implications for clinical use of BET inhibitors further affirming the importance of inclusion of sex as a biological variable.",

In addition to the sex difference in GBM incidence, Ostrom et al. documented a survival advantage for female GBM patients (12) . The reasons for these sex differences in GBM incidence and outcome are largely unknown.

Sex differences in the tumorigenic phenotype were validated in a second CRISPR-IUE (in utero electroporation) murine model of GBM. In this model, guide sequence inserts targeting Nf1 and p53 were injected into the lateral ventricles of embryonic pups of male and female mice, and progenitor cells were targeted via bioelectroporation. Both male and female mice developed tumors; however, male mice exhibited an accelerated tumorigenic phenotype with a shorter median survival (18) .

The BET family member Brd4 is essential for regulating transcriptome-wide gene expression and specifying cell identity, including that of GBM (24-26). Additionally, Brd4 is an emerging drug target for epigenetic interventions (23-34). Here, we show that sex differences in tumor phenotype are dependent on differential Brd4-bound enhancer regulation of stem cell-like phenotypes in male and female murine and human GBM cells. In vitro and in vivo studies of genetic or pharmacological Brd4 inhibition, as well as data mining of the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal, indicate that male and female murine and human GBM cells are differentially sensitive to inhibition of Brd4, resulting in decreased in vitro clonogenicity and in vivo growth of male tumors, and opposite effects on female cells and tumors. Understanding the extent to which sex differences in GBM are mediated by epigenetic mechanisms will be imperative to understanding the biology of sex differences in GBM, stratifying patients for treatment with epigenetic agents, and anticipating potential sexbiased toxicities following systemic disruption of epigenetics.",

Previously, we reported correlations between sex differences in tumorigenicity and gene expression in our murine model of GBM (male and female GBM astrocytes lacking function of both NF1 and p53, see SI Materials and Methods for full details) (18, 19) . Fifty percent of the sex-biased differences in gene expression observed in this model were concordantly sex-biased in human GBM expression data (18) . This concordance demonstrated that our murine model recapitulates important transcriptional pathways that govern clinically relevant sex-differences in human GBM. In addition, we found correlations between sex differences in survival and gene expression in patients with GBM (20). We therefore determined whether these distinct GBM transcriptional states were the result of sexspecific enhancer activity, and whether such states could be perturbed with small molecules that target epigenetic regulators that bind at these enhancers. We prioritized Brd4-bound enhancers for analysis because these enhancers play key roles in establishing cell identity (25, 30-34), and may regulate the cell intrinsic sex differences observed in GBM. Brd4 is an epigenetic reader that binds acetylated histones H3 and H4 throughout the entire cell cycle and is deregulated in numerous cancers (35). Brd4 promotes epithelialto-mesenchymal transition, stem cell-like conversion, and pluripotency (26, 28, 36). Brd4 pharmacological inhibition has shown therapeutic activity in a number of different cancer models (37-41).",

To do so, we fused the piggyBac (PB) transposase to the C terminus of the Brd4 protein, endowing the transposase with the ability to direct the insertion of the PB transposon into the genome close to Brd4 binding sites. Five biological replicates were carried out, and the correlation between replicates was r > 0.9 for all pairwise comparisons (SI Appendix, Fig.  1A ). Using this protocol, we mapped ~1.25 million unique insertions directed by the Brd4-PBase fusion for each male and female sample. As Brd4 is an epigenetic reader of the acetylated lysine 27 residue of histone H3 (H3K27ac), we confirmed that these newly identified Brd4-bound enhancers were enriched for H3K27ac. We performed H3K27ac Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) in male and female GBM cells to identify the genomic regions enriched for this well-known marker of active enhancers (44). Three biological replicates were analyzed and the correlation between replicates was r > 0.9 for all pairwise comparisons (SI Appendix, Fig.  1B ). As expected, data collected from calling cards and H3K27ac ChIP-seq revealed a high concordance between Brd4-bound enhancers and H3K27ac enrichment. A representative example of concordant Brd4 binding and H3K27ac in male and female GBM astrocytes at high and low-enriched regions is depicted in Fig. 1A . We next analyzed the distances from Brd4 binding sites to the nearest H3K27ac-enriched regions. Brd4 binding sites were significantly enriched at H3K27ac candidate enhancer regions (Fig. 1B) and display concordant gene expression levels (Fig. 1C) indicative of active Brd4-bound enhancers (p < 0.01). More specifically, 82% and 81% of Brd4 bound enhancers were localized within 200bp of H3K27ac peaks in male and female GBM cells, respectively.",

The Brd4 signal intensity for these male-biased and female-biased enhancers in male and female GBM astrocytes is depicted in Fig. 2B . To validate these putative male-and female-biased enhancers using an orthogonal method, we analyzed their H3K27ac status and found that the loci that bound Brd4 in a sex-biased manner displayed sex-biased enrichment of H3K27ac (Fig. 2C) . Chromosome location analysis for these sex-biased Brd4-bound enhancers revealed that only 0.13% and 3.11% of male-biased Brd4-bound enhancers were located on the Y and X chromosomes, respectively, and that only 4.29% of female-biased Brd4-bound enhancers were located on the X chromosome, indicating that the observed differences in Brd4-bound enhancers are not simply due to differential Brd4 enhancer enrichment on sex chromosomes. The majority of enhancers exhibited a sex-bias in Brd4 occupancy, while a subset appeared to be sex-specific. We will collectively refer to these enhancers as sex-biased. Representative examples of sex-specific, Nkx2.1, and sex-biased, Zic1/4, enhancers, are depicted in Fig. 2 D and E. Nkx2.1 functions both as a \"lineage survival\" oncogene and tumor suppressor in lung adenocarcinomas, (45, 46) whereas Zic1 acts as a tumor suppressor in breast and thyroid cancers (47, 48), supporting the potential context-dependent dual role of Brd4 in oncogenesis. This is the first demonstration of differential Brd4bound enhancer usage by male and female cells of any kind, suggesting that these enhancers may function in 4 sexual differentiation in a manner similar to their role in determining cell identity and fate (25, 30-32, 49). A violin plot illustrating the full distribution of the enrichment signal for male and female-biased loci and shared peaks is depicted in Fig. 2F .",

For each condition, three biological replicates were performed; the data were highly reproducible (Pearson r \u2265 0.96 for all pairwise comparisons) (SI Appendix, Fig. 1C ) and indicated differential expression of 3490 transcripts (FDR < 0.05). We next integrated the male and female-biased Brd4 regulated genes with the differentially expressed genes between male and female GBM astrocytes and narrowed the list of differentially regulated sex-biased Brd4-bound genes to 1296, of which 52.4% were male-biased and 47.6% were female-biased Brd4-regulated genes. A heatmap depiction of the top 400 differentially regulated sexbiased Brd4-bound genes is presented in Fig. 2G . Pathway enrichment analysis for the 1296 differentially regulated sex-biased Brd4-bound genes was performed using a combination of KEGG pathway and Genomatix Pathway System (GePS). Classification of these genes according to function revealed a significant number of relevant and important pathways, including cell differentiation, glioblastoma, cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion, tumor angiogenesis, stem cell functions and DNA binding-transcription factors ( Fig. 2H and SI Appendix, Table 2 ). Thus, these sex-specific transcriptomic differences in core cancer pathways likely arise from male and female-biased Brd4-bound enhancer activity.",

We then compared the gene lists of sex-biased differentially regulated genes in human GSCs with those of the murine GBM astrocytes at the same cut-off parameters (log2FC 1.5 and FDR 0.05; 981 and 771 upregulated genes in male and female GBM cells, respectively) and found an overlap in gene identity and direction of change for both males (17.5% of human male-biased differentially expressed genes, p-value 0.001) and females (17.4% of human femalebiased differentially expressed genes, p-value 0.04) (SI Appendix, Table 3 ). p-values were calculated using the cumulative hypergeometric distribution.

Our genomic analyses of mouse and human GBM cells suggested to us that Brd4-bound enhancers might regulate a large number of genes and transcriptional networks in a sex-biased fashion. To test this hypothesis, we performed genetic depletion of individual BET family members in our murine model of GBM. Under basal conditions, male and female GBM cells expressed Brd3 and Brd4 mRNA at similar levels, whereas Brd2 was expressed at higher levels in female cells (*p= 0.02) (Fig. 3A) . We evaluated the potency of 5 shRNAs specific to each of the Brd2, Brd3, or Brd4 genes and selected the shRNAs that achieved the most robust knockdown of each gene for downstream functional experiments of the tumorigenic phenotype. Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4 mRNA levels were partially depleted in male and female GBM cells after infection with the corresponding lentiviral shRNAs (Fig. 3B) . Knockdown of Brd2 did not affect clonogenic frequency in either male or female cells as measured by the extreme limiting dilution assay (ELDA) (Fig. 3C) . Male GBM cells with Brd4 knockdown exhibited a decrease in clonogenic frequency, whereas female cells displayed an increase in clonogenic frequency. A similar effect on clonogenic frequency was observed following Brd3 knockdown in male cells, although it was not as robust as the effect of Brd4 knockdown. Strong Brd4 effects were observed despite the more modest knockdown of Brd4 compared to Brd3.",

            "text": "Small molecule inhibitors of the BET family of proteins (BETi) are a novel class of epigenetic compounds that selectively target BET proteins and have been shown to have promise as cancer therapeutics, decreasing cell proliferation and invasion in many cancer types, including GBM (24, 27, 29). However, almost all of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) human cell lines used in the preclinical studies are of male origin and thus, potentially uninformative with regard to sex differences in drug effects. Therefore, we evaluated whether there was a sex difference in the treatment response to some of the BET inhibitors currently in clinical trials for cancer in our mouse GBM cells. We treated male and female GBM astrocytes with a panel of BETi (Fig. 3D ), which are being tested in clinical trials (24 clinical trials listed in www.clinicaltrials.gov and Selleckchem.com) and then performed ELDAs to measure clonogenic cell frequency (53-55). Treatment with BETi reproducibly decreased clonogenic frequency in male GBM cells while increasing clonogenic frequency in female cells (Fig. 3 E-G and SI Appendix, Fig. 2 ). This striking abrogation of sex differences, driven by sex-dependent opposing response to Brd4 inhibition, is illustrated in response to the Brd4 antagonist JQ1 (Fig. 3F ). JQ1 is a thienotriazolo-1,4-diazepine that displaces Brd4 from chromatin by competitively binding to the acetyllysine recognition pocket (37, 38). Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia cells with JQ1 causes a rapid release of Mediator 1 (MED1) from a subset of enhancer regions that were co-occupied by Brd4, leading to a decrease in the expression of neighboring genes (56). We treated male and female GBM cells with either 0.05% DMSO or 500 nM JQ1 and then performed ELDAs to measure clonogenic cell frequency. Male cells exhibited greater clonogenic cell activity than female cells under control conditions. Treatment with JQ1 reproducibly abrogated the basal differences in clonogenic frequency between male and female GBM cells by decreasing the clonogenic cell fraction in male cells and increasing the clonogenic cell fraction in female cells, rendering the male-JQ1 treated cells equivalent to the female control cells (Fig. 3F ). To confirm that these effects were mediated by Brd4bound enhancers, we performed similar experiments using RVX-208, a BD2 inhibitor with high selectivity to Brd2/3 (57). Consistent with the Brd2 and Brd3 knockdown results, treatment with 5\u00b5M RVX-208 for 24 hours did not have an effect on the clonogenic frequency of male and female cells (Fig. 3 E and G) . Next, we examined the effect of drug treatment on cell growth and proliferation. Male cells exhibited decreased proliferation and a growth phenotype equivalent to control female cells following JQ1 treatment (Fig. 3H ), whereas treatment with RVX208 did not alter proliferation of male and female cells (Fig. 3I ). Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that the sex differences in the tumorigenic phenotype we observe in our murine GBM cells are mediated by differential Brd4-bound enhancers, and that the response to BET inhibition is sex-dependent.",

Similar to the murine data, treatment with BETi decreased clonogenic cell frequency in male patient-derived GBM cells, while slightly increasing the clonogenic cell frequency in female patient-derived GBM ( Fig. 3J and SI Appendix, Fig. 3 ). Although we observed the expected trend in response to BETi treatment in human male and female primary cell lines, our sample size was small with limited power. Additionally, human GBM samples are intrinsically heterogeneous with different genetic backgrounds, and hence the magnitude of treatment effects can be more variable compared to isogenic cell lines. To expand our sample size, we analyzed the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) to examine if human male GBM cells are indeed more sensitive to BETi than female cells. First, we segregated the CTRP human GBM samples by sex. We then analyzed the cell growth response of male and female GBM cells to BETi treatment. This analysis revealed that male GBM cells are more sensitive to BETi, displaying slower growth and more cell death, consistent with what we observed using our murine GBM model (Fig. 3K) .",

Functional classification of these genes using pathway enrichment analysis revealed that male GBM cells were highly enriched for cancer, neoplastic, and pluripotent stem cell pathways, while female GBM cells were mainly enriched for neural stem cell and stem cell proliferation pathways (Fig. 5A) . Representative examples of these pathways are depicted in Fig. 5 B and C. Male-biased genes in stem cell pathways included well-known oncogenes, such as Myc, Tet1, and Lif, while female-biased genes included tumor suppressors, such as Six2 and Six3. Based on these results and our previous observation of a sex-dependent opposing response in clonogenicity following Brd4 inhibition with JQ1, we examined the effects of JQ1 treatment on the expression of stem cell pathway genes. As BETi reduced sex differences in clonogenicity, we hypothesized that sex differences in the expression of stem cell-related genes present in male and female GBM cells under basal conditions would be eliminated by JQ1 treatment, accounting for the abrogation of sex differences in the tumorigenic phenotype. We identified genes with sex differences in expression at baseline that became equivalent following JQ1 treatment, and performed pathway analysis. As anticipated, the cancer stem cell pathway was affected by JQ1 treatment (Fig. 5D ). Concordant with differential growth responses, JQ1 downregulated male-biased genes, while JQ1 upregulated female-biased genes. The fold change in expression following JQ1 treatment (ratio of JQ1/DMSO) is depicted above or below each gene. Overall, there was concordance with the direction of change in gene expression and the decrease and increase in stem cell function in male and female ELDA assays respectively. These results support the existence of Brd4-regulated sex-specific transcriptional program that mediate key functional properties of GBM, including clonogenicity. Identifying the specific pathways critical to sex differences in GBM will require further functional studies.",

Our results suggest that male and female GBM cells reside in two distinct transcriptional states established by the actions of Brd4. Inhibiting Brd4 function abrogates the sex differences in these transcriptional states and the concomitant differences in tumorigenic phenotype. As Brd4 does not bind DNA directly, but instead is recruited to enhancers by transcription factors, either directly or indirectly though histone acetylation, we sought to identify candidate transcription factors (TFs) responsible for the recruitment of Brd4 to sex-biased genomic loci. To do so, we searched for transcription factor binding motifs enriched at male-biased or female-biased Brd4bound enhancers. Transcription factors enriched at male-biased Brd4-bound enhancers included oncogenes and stem cell markers, such as Myc, Klf5, and Oct4, whereas female-biased Brd4-bound enhancers were co-occupied and enriched with transcription factors with tumor suppressor functions, such as p53 and Smad4 (Table 1) . These results could explain the observed dual functions of Brd4 in male and female GBM cells. Future studies, including knock-in and knock-out of transcriptional master regulators and partners of Brd4, are warranted to investigate the dual functions of Brd4 as an oncogene in male GBM cells and tumor suppressor in female GBM cells.",

The results described thus far suggested to us that Brd4-bound enhancers play an important role in maintaining sex-differences in our murine GBM model. However, these experiments all measured in vitro surrogates for the tumorigenic phenotype. Therefore, we next sought to determine what role, if any, Brd4 plays during in vivo tumorigenesis. We treated male and female murine GBM astrocytes with BETi and used these cells to perform in vivo tumor flank implantation studies in female nude mice. Only females were used as recipients for tumor flank implantation because we have previously shown that the sex of the recipient mouse does not affect the in vivo growth of implants in this murine model (19) . Based on our in vitro ELDA studies, we chose to use JQ1 and CPI0610, the two BETi with the most dramatic sex-specific effect in male and female GBM astrocytes, respectively. Each mouse underwent flank implantation of DMSO, JQ1, or CPI0610 treated male cells (5000 cells) or DMSO, JQ1 or CPI0610 treated female cells (1.5 million cells). The sex difference in cell dose were empirically determined to match the timeframe for in vivo tumor growth up to the threshold for euthanasia. We attribute the sex differences in tumor growth kinetics to differences in clonogenic cell frequency and rates of proliferation (18, 19) . Tumor formation was monitored by observers blinded to group assignment for 7-16 weeks. Flank implantation of JQ1-treated male GBM cells was less likely to result in tumor formation than implantation with control DMSOtreated male cells ( Fig. 6 A and C) . In contrast, flank implantation of CPI0610-treated female GBM cells was more likely to result in tumor formation than implantation with control DMSO-treated female cells ( Fig. 6 B and C) . These results are consistent with the sex-specific effects of JQ1 and CPI0610 on in vitro clonogenic cell frequency and cell growth. This effect was seen following only one dose of BETi prior to implantation, suggesting that this robust response is maintained and manifested at the epigenetic level. Both JQ1 and CPI0610 display a similar pattern in their selectivity to target the different Brd family members, with the highest selectivity for Brd4 (Fig.  3D ). Although both drugs had a similar sex-specific directional effect on clonogenic frequency in male and female cells, the magnitude of their effect differed in both the clonogenic cell frequency and in vivo tumorigenic assays. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the BETi treatment could be affecting different or multiple Brd family members. To rule out this possibility and validate that the sexbiased response to treatment was driven by Brd4, we treated male and female control and Brd4 knockdown cells with either 0.05% DMSO, 500 nM JQ1, or 1 \u00b5M CPI0610 and then performed ELDA to compare clonogenic cell frequency. No significant difference in the effect on clonogenic cell frequency was observed between control and Brd4 knockdown cells treated with BETi, indicating that Brd4 is required for sexspecific responses to BETi (SI Appendix, Fig. 5 ). Although it is still unclear why we observe different magnitude effects of these two BETi, the fact that both drugs show a sex-specific effect in vivo is notable and predicted by our earlier observations. These results provide strong and critical evidence that the biology of sex affects cancer incidence and outcome and addressing these sex differences in cancer will be fundamental to improving outcomes and a better quality of life for cancer patients.",

New approaches to treatment could be revealed by dissecting the biological and molecular mechanisms 8 that drive sex differences in phenotype. Similar to other cancers, GBM has a higher incidence in males compared to females with a ratio of 1.6:1 (61). Additionally, after developing GBM, males tend to have a shorter median survival of 17.5 months compared to 20.4 months for females (62). Recently, we found that longer survival for male and female GBM patients after standard surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy is associated upon different transcriptional programs (20). Using a JIVE algorithm, male and female patients with GBM cluster into five distinct male and female subtypes distinguished by gene expression and survival. Although, a recent study by Yuan et al. (63) assigned GBM as a weak sex-effect cancer, their analysis of the TCGA GBM human patient data was performed using a Propensity Score Algorithm, a more standard approach compared to the specialized JIVE analysis we have previously adapted in our analysis of the TCGA GBM transcriptome datasets (20).",

The strong evidence for epigenetic dysregulation in GBM has led to clinical trials of multiple drugs targeting tumor epigenetics, in hope of improving treatment response in patients (24, 27, 29, 67). However, sex differences in the epigenetic landscape in male and female cells have not been taken into account when investigating cancer risk or treatment response. As sexual differentiation is in large part an epigenetic phenomenon and sex differences are found in the epigenetic landscape of male and female cells, it will be critical to examine the efficacy of therapies in both sexes separately to avoid missing important clinical effects when data are compiled from both sexes. Studying disparities in threshold for transformation in male and female cells will provide a powerful tool to investigate epigenetic mechanisms that establish a dimorphic tumorigenic phenotype and better treatment and survival outcomes for cancer patients.",

Brd4 is an epigenetic reader that promotes stem-like conversion and pluripotency (26, 28, 36), and its inhibition has shown therapeutic activity in a number of different cancer models (37-41).

Male and female murine and human GBM cells responded in opposed ways to BETi. Consistent with our knockdown data, this dimorphism in Brd4 function was linked to the sex of the experimental cells and correlated with sex-specific patterns of Brd4 localization throughout the genome, which renders male and female cells differentially sensitive to BETi. Accordingly, BETi decreased growth of male in vivo tumors but increased growth of female tumors. These results strongly indicate that sex differences in disease biology translate into sex differences in therapeutic responses. The opposing sex-specific response to the inhibition of Brd4 in our GBM model could help explain previously published data in breast and prostate cancer, wherein ectopic expression of Brd4 in breast cancer cells decreased invasiveness and tumor growth, while Brd4 inhibition decreased viability of prostate cancer cells (40, 68-70). These studies also revealed that in women with estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (68) or endometrial cancer (69), low Brd4 expression correlated with worse survival. This is in contrast to men with prostate cancer, in whom low levels of Brd4 are associated with improved survival (40, 69). The sex-specific response of primary human GBM cells to BETi corroborated data obtained from the Cancer Therapeutic Response Portal that show human male GBM cells to be more sensitive to BETi, displaying slower growth and increased cell death compared to human female GBM cells.",

Briefly, each well received 3 \u00b5g of plasmid DNA containing a piggyBac transposon (carrying a puromycin selection marker) with or without 3 \u00b5g of a transposase plasmid encoding Brd4 fused to the N-terminus of hyperactive piggyBac (HyPBase). Plasmids were delivered using Lipofectamine LTX/Plus Reagent (Invitrogen). Before transfection, cells were incubated in DMEM without FBS or antibiotics for 30 minutes, and then replaced with fresh media containing DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin. Transfection complexes were applied to cells for 12-18 hours at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were allowed to recover in fresh medium for another 24-48 hours. Each well was then separately expanded onto 10 cm dishes and placed in medium containing puromycin at a concentration of 2.5 \u00b5g/ml for 3 days. After 3 days, cells that received transposon DNA alone showed no growth, while those that also received transposase DNA showed robust growth. Each 10 cm dish of expanded puromycin resistant cells were harvested and processed by a modified version of the transposon calling card protocol as previously described (43). The Calling Card library was prepared by assigning each well a unique Illumina P7 index, so that each well of a sample could be demultiplexed as a set of unique barcoded insertions. All 4 sets of libraries, (Male_PB_helper, Male_PB_Brd4_fusion, Female_PB_helper, and Female_PB_Brd4_fusion) were then pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 300. A total of 40 Illumina P7 indexes were demultiplexed (10 replicates per library). Reads were mapped to the mm10 reference genome using Novoalign (version 3.08.02; Novocraft Technologies SDN BHD). For each library, data from constituent replicates were pooled and discrete insertions exported in Calling Card library format for subsequent analysis. Insertions were visualized on the WashU Epigenome Browser (v46.1).",

Briefly, transposon insertions were grouped into peaks using a hierarchical clustering algorithm with a maximum distance of 5 Kb between insertions. Significant peaks were identified using Poisson distribution to test for enrichment over the background (unfused transposase) Calling Card data with an adjusted p-value threshold less than 0.05. The expected number of transposon insertions per TTAA was estimated by considering the total number of insertions observed in a large region of 100 Kb distance centered at the Calling Card cluster/insertion.

For each merged or unmerged enhancer site, the normalized insertions from the female samples were used to compute the lambda of Poisson distribution. We then computed a p-value from cumulative distribution function of the observed number of independent insertions in the male sample. Brd4 binding sites with a p-value less than 0.05 and with more than 20 insertions were considered as Brd4 binding sites significantly enriched in male sample.

For this reason, we treated the X chromosome in an identical manner to the autosomes for peak calling. However, to explore how sensitive our analysis was to this assumption, we recalculated p-values for peaks on the X chromosome as we adjusted the insertions in male cells with a multiplier from 1 to 2 (using a step size of 0.1). The total number of male-biased peaks varied from 2679 to 2995 and the total number of female-biased peaks varied from 2778 to 2727, indicating that the vast majority of differential bound peaks in our analysis are robust to the actual percentage of accessible chromatin on the inactivated X chromosome.",
