Considering constraints on production and shipping, most existing strategies seek to maximize the outflow of therapeutics, hence optimizing for rapid dissemination. Surprisingly, we find that this intuitive approach is counterproductive. The reason is that focusing strictly on the quantity of disseminated therapeutics, such strategies disregard their specific spreading patterns, most crucially -they overlook the interplay of these spreading patterns with those of the pathogens. This results in a discrepancy between supply and demand, that prohibits efficient mitigation even under optimal conditions of superfluous drug/vaccine flow. Therefore, here, we design a dissemination strategy that naturally follows the predicted spreading patterns of the epidemic, optimizing not just for supply volume, but also for its congruency with the anticipated demand. Specifically, we show that epidemics spread relatively uniformly across all destinations, and hence we introduce an equality constraint into our dissemination that prioritizes supply homogeneity. This strategy may, at times, slow down the supply rate in certain locations, however, thanks to its egalitarian nature, which mimics the flow of the viral spread, it provides a dramatic leap in overall mitigation efficiency, saving more lives with orders of magnitude less resources.",

When such scenario transpires, the challenge is to (i) develop ad hoc a drug or vaccine; then (ii) design an efficient strategy for its dissemination. The point is that even if a therapeutic is avalibale, eliminating challenge (i), we must still ship it to multiple destinations worldwidepotentially stretching our transportation resources to their maximal capacity. Hence, to outrun the epidemic, we crucially need optimal dissemination schemes, that achieve the most efficient mitigation, given the constraints imposed by our production/shipping limitations 15-19 .",

The therapeutics (commodity) are shipped from one or few sources, propagating along transportation routes -each with a given shipping capacity -aiming to fill the demand of all network nodes. In this framework one seeks the shipping sequence that optimally utilizes the networknamely, allows for the maximal volume of commodity to flow through the network per unit time 24,25 (Fig. 1a) . This well-established approach, however, overlooks the interplay between the supply, i.e. the therapeutics, and the demand, here generated by the spreading pathogens. Indeed, our true goal is not just to generate the maximal outflow of commodities, but rather to obtain the optimal mitigation of the disease. This does not depend only on the volume of commodity flow, but also on the manner in which this volume is distributed across all potential destinations, i.e. its spreading pattern 26, 27 . Consequently, the most efficient shipping sequence might be one that compromises maximal flow, but generates the optimal spreading patterns, compatible with those of the pathogens 13,28-32 .",

We find that while the disease impacts the majority of nodes uniformly, maximum commodity flow optimization naturally yields a highly uneven spread, conflicting a concurrent and homogeneous global demand with an extremely heterogeneous supply pattern. As a result, not only does maximum flow not guarantee optimal mitigation, it is, in fact, counterproductive, indeed, generating a desirable volume of available therapeutics, but at the same time a highly undesirable spreading pattern. We, therefore, introduce an equality criterion to the optimization, that prioritizes dissemination sequences with homogeneous spreading patterns (Fig. 1c) . This ensures that the therapeutic flow is not just rapid, but also properly disseminated, generating supply patterns that are compatible with demand. The resulting dissemination, we find, is orders of magnitude more efficient, achieving higher mitigation levels even under extremely prohibitive shipping constraints.",

However, the analysis above indicates, that there is an intrinsic deficiency in the spread of therapeutics, that cannot be easily compensated by simply increasing shipping rates. Next, we show that the two competing processes -viruses vs. therapeutics -indeed, lead to fundamentally different spreading patterns, in which the viruses benefit from an intrinsic advantage.

Demands are updated as therapeutics are supplied -for instance, at = 1 's demand 2 ( ) is updated to zero, as 's demand is filled. Under max-flow the goal is to achieve the highest net outflow of commodities from , i.e. maximize \u2192 ( ). Here, nodes were supplies within two days, a net flow \u2192 (1) = 9 in day 1 and \u2192 ( ) = 8, in day 2. (b) During an epidemic, however, the goal is to achieve optimal mitigation, not just optimal commodity flow. This requires us to consider the interplay between our dissemination and the spread of the epidemic. Each node's demand is determined by its infection levels ( ( ), red), leading us to seek the shipping sequence which best adresses the anticiated spread of infections -aiming for supply ( ( ), blue) that is most compatible with demand. (c) We find that the optimal strategy is to design an egalitarian flow, in which supply is homogeneously spread across all destinations. Using the same network as in (a), our egalitarian strategy yields an even shipping sequence, in which nodes are supplied concurrently at roughly equal rates. For example, instead of fully supplying node in = 1 and only then shipping to at = 2, as done under max-flow in panel (a), our egalitarian algorithm favors the shipping sequence where and are simulataneasly supplied at equal rates. Under global demand, we show, such egalitarian supply is orders of magnitude more effective in terms of mitigation and resource disposal.",

(c) Using max-flow we track the availability of the therapeutics ( ) at all destinations (node size/blue color depth).

Due to the sequential nature of this dissemination scheme, the therapeutic reaches CGQ too late, and consequently its infection level ( ) remains high, both without (red) and under the effect of max-flow mitigation (yellow).

As a result this node benefits from highly efficienct mitigation, with ( \u2192 \u221e) reduced dramatically from 80% (unmitigated, red) to a mere 15% (mitigated, yellow). The challenge is that while CGQ is representative of the majority of destinations, the highly benefited SDJ belongs to a select minoroty under the max-flow framework. (d)-(e) Egalitarian generates a homogeneous supply pattern, hence now both CGQ and SDJ share a similar (low) supply rate of \u223c 10 \u22123 . Despite that they both benefit from a near perfect mitigation (unmitigated -red; mitigated -green). This is thanks to the fact that despite their equal but slow supply, they now both begin to receive the therapeutic at an early stage ( ( ), blue). Indeed, even SDJ, who is now, under egalitarian, experiencing a dramtic drop in its supply rate, from 0.2 to 10 \u22123 , continues to benefit from highly efficient mitigation. Hence, the simulataneous, albeit uniformly slow, treatment afforded via egalitarian, not only benefits the max-flow deprived majority, but also continues to effectively treat its superflous minority.

(b) The state of the epidemic at = 56 days, directly before drug dissemination begins. The local coverage ( ) in each node and the flux of infected individuals along each link (air-route) are represented by their red color depth. (c) Max-flow dissemination: starting at R = 56 we begin drug dissemination from Osaka (ITM) via max-flow; Eqs. (2)-(5). Drug fluxes ( ) (links) and drug availability ( ) (nodes circumference) are represented by blue color depth. We observe a race between the therapeutic and the disease, both spreading along similar routes, ending in a significant fraction of infected individuals, as indicated by the prevalence of red nodes at = 100. (d) Egalitarian dissemination: under the same scenario, the egalitarian strategy of Eqs. (11)-(13) achieves a much more efficient mitigation, where by = 100, the epidemic is almost eliminated. (e)-(g) ( ) at the three timepoints: unmitigated (red), under max-flow (yellow) and under egalitarian (green). By = 100 egalitarian has reduced the global coverage by a factor of \u223c 20, from ( ) = 0.65 to ( ) = 0.04, while max-flow has achieved a mere \u223c 1.5 factor reduction. Three crucial parameters may impact our mitigation: the global transportation capacity , our response time R and the severity of the contagion \u211b 0 . (h) Mitigation efficiency vs. under egalitarian (green) and max-flow (yellow). The former achieves higher efficiency with orders of magnitude less resources. For example, egalitarian provides = 0.8 under \u223c 10 \u22123 , as compared to \u223c 10 \u22121 , a two order of magnitude gap, required under max-flow for similar efficiency. (i) vs. . Again, we find that egalitarian shows a significantly higher performance in the face of a late response. (j) vs. \u211b 0 , confirming, again, the consistent advantage of egalitarian mitigation.
