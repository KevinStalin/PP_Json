This paper investigates respiratory droplet transmission, which is critical to understanding, modeling, and controlling epidemics. In the present work, we implemented flow visualization, particle image velocimetry, and particle shadow tracking velocimetry to measure the velocity of the airflow and droplets involved in coughing and then constructed a physical model considering the evaporation effect to predict the motion of droplets under different weather conditions. The experimental results indicate that the convection velocity of cough airflow presents the relationship t \u22120.7 with time; hence, the distance from the cougher increases by t 0.3 in the range of our measurement domain. Substituting these experimental results into the physical model reveals that small droplets (initial diameter D \u2264 100 \u03bcm) evaporate to droplet nuclei and that large droplets with D \u2265 500 \u03bcm and an initial velocity u 0 \u2265 5 m/s travel more than 2 m. Winter conditions of low temperature and high relative humidity can cause more droplets to settle to the ground, which may be a possible driver of a second pandemic wave in the autumn and winter seasons.

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has become a global pandemic infectious respiratory disease. According to the coronavirus resource center at Johns Hopkins University, more than 45 \u00d7 10 6 people worldwide have been confirmed to have COVID-19, and there have been more than 1 200 000 deaths globally. Other infectious respiratory diseases such as flu, tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) still threaten people's health and life. Understanding the transmission of pathogens is critical to modeling and controlling epidemics (Bourouiba et al., 2014) . In general, virion-laden respiratory fluid droplets are released into the environment by infected people through expiratory events such as talking, coughing, and sneezing. There are three possible transmission pathways between infectious and susceptible individuals (Bourouiba et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2020; and Mittal et al., 2020b) : large droplet transmission, contact transmission, and airborne transmission. In the first two pathways, healthy people can be infected by physically inhaling droplets or contacting contaminated surfaces within close proximity. These two pathways are termed direct short-range routes of pathogen transmission, as stated by Bourouiba et al. (2014) . Airborne transmission has been suggested to be an additional but important route for respiratory diseases (Morawska and Milton, 2020; Liu et al., 2020) . The microdroplet (or droplet nuclei) generated via small droplet evaporation can travel a very long distance within ambient air (Matthews et al., 1989; Dbouk and Drikakis, 2020a) . A numerical investigation of aerosol transport in a classroom indicated that a significant fraction (24%-50%) of particles smaller than 15 \u03bcm exits the conditioning system for as long as 15 min (Abuhegazy et al., 2020) . Liu et al. (2020) investigated the aerodynamic nature of SARS-CoV-2 by measuring the viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals during the outbreak of",

The aerosol concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 were much higher in the toilet used by patients with COVID-19 and in areas where crowds that included infected individuals gathered. They proposed that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted through aerosols. However, with a dynamic model of the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in confined spaces, Smith et al. (2020) suggested that aerosol transmission may not be a very efficient route, particularly from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals that exhibit low viral loads.",

            "text": "Coughing, which can generate droplets and droplet nuclei, is a typical symptom of COVID-19. These virion-laden respiratory fluid droplets are expelled into the environment by powerful airflow during coughing (Scharfman et al., 2016; Chen and Yang, 2019) . Measuring the air velocity, droplet number density, velocity, and size distribution is critical to understanding and modeling virus transmission. Zhu et al. (2006) investigated the transport characteristics of saliva droplets produced by coughing in a calm indoor environment via particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments and numerical simulation. The PIV results indicated that the initial velocity of cough airflow is as high as 22 m/s with an average velocity of 11.2 m/s. Numerical analyses that did not consider evaporation indicated that droplets smaller than 30 \u03bcm in diameter are mostly transported with the airflow, droplets with diameters of 50 \u03bcm-200 \u03bcm are significantly affected by gravity, and droplets of 300 \u03bcm or larger are mostly affected by inertia. Gupta et al. (2009) measured the flow rate, flow direction, and mouth opening area for 25 human subjects and found that the flow rate of a cough as a function of time can be defined as a combination of gamma-probability-distribution functions. Xie et al. (2009) carried out a series of experiments to measure the number and size of respiratory droplets produced by talking and coughing. The distribution of the droplet diameter at the origin was given in their paper. To predict the trajectory and settling speed of droplets, a discrete fallout model and a continuous fallout model were developed based on the theory of multiphase turbulent buoyant clouds by Bourouiba et al. (2014) . These models can be used with clinical data to yield better estimations of the range of airborne respiratory disease transmission. The influence of environmental conditions on droplet transmission was investigated using a three-dimensional numerical simulation by Dbouk and Drikakis (2020a) . It was found that saliva droplets can travel up to 6 m, which is much further than the 2 m social distance metric, when the wind speed varies from 4 km/h to 15 km/h. Agrawal and Bhardwaj (2020) elucidated the mechanism of entertainment of the surrounding air in a cough-cloud and deduced a mathematical model. The volume of air contained in a cough depends only on the spread rate and distance traveled by the cough. The effects of space size on the dispersion of cough-generated droplets from a walking person were analyzed by Li et al. (2020b) . Two distinct droplet dispersion modes were discovered for different space sizes.",

The schlieren optical method was applied to visualize cough airflow with and without standard surgical and N95 masks (Tang et al., 2009) . The results indicated that human coughing produces a rapid turbulent jet into the surrounding air and that a mask can block the formation of this jet. David et al. (2012) used flow visualization to investigate the expelled air dispersion distances during coughing with a human patient simulator with and without a surgical mask or N95 mask in a negative pressure isolation room. The turbulent jet caused by coughing without a mask can propagate close to 0.7 m, while the air dispersion distance is \u223c0.15 m with an N95 mask. To clarify whether masks can offer effective protection against droplet infection, K\u00e4hler and Hain (2020) conducted three experiments of fluid mechanics to analyze the blockage caused by masks, to determine the effectiveness of different filter materials and masks, and to verify the effects of leakage flows at the edges of masks. The effectiveness and leakage of face masks were qualitatively visualized using smoke (Verma et al., 2020a; Verma et al., 2020b) . Wearing masks can significantly curtail the speed and range of respiratory jets. Dbouk and Drikakis (2020b) used multiphase computational fluid dynamics in a fully coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian framework to investigate the droplet dynamics of mild coughing. The numerical results showed that a mask can reduce airborne droplet transmission. However, some droplets still spread around and away from the mask.",

            "text": "As stated by Asadi et al. (2020) , virologists and epidemiologists are racing to understand COVID-19 and how best to treat it. Many unknowns remain, but one thing is eminently clear: COVID-19 is both deadly and highly transmissible. In addition to direct large droplet transmission and contact transmission, airborne transmission is a potentially important pathway, especially in an enclosed small space (Asadi et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; and Li et al., 2020a) . Therefore, an investigation of the generation and evolution of expiratory activities such as breathing, talking, coughing, and sneezing, which can produce virion-laden droplets and aerosols traveling with the airflow, is very significant (Mittal et al., 2020a; Simha and Rao, 2020) . Regarding coughing, which is the main symptom of COVID-19, most studies include qualitative visualization without dynamic analysis. In the present work, we use a high-speed PIV system to capture the spatial-temporal evolution of coughing (He et al., 2002; Zhao and He, 2009; and He et al., 2017) . We carried out three optics-based fluid experiments. First, we analyzed largescale visualization images generated using cigarette smoke (Gupta et al., 2009) . Second, we used the PIV technique to calculate the airflow velocity near the mouth and analyzed the time-resolved flow fields. Third, we used particle shadow velocimetry (Estevadeordal and Goss, 2005; Hessenkemper and Ziegenhein, 2018; PSV) to track the trajectories of large droplets and analyzed the velocity distribution of the droplets. Finally, we constructed a model to consider the evaporation and motion of a droplet and analyzed the influence of weather conditions on droplet transmission. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we first introduce the experimental facility, setup, and data processing methods used in this work. In Sec. III, we present the results and discussion in accordance with these experiments. Finally, we offer conclusions in Sec. IV.",

When conducting the experiment, volunteers were asked to sit in front of the opaque plate and place their mouths as close as possible to the opening, and the exhaled airflow or droplets passed into the testing room through this opening. Additionally, volunteers were asked to wear safety goggles to protect their eyes. As stated in the Introduction, three kinds of experiments for different objectives were performed in this work.

To capture a clear droplet shape and track the trajectories, the PSV method was adopted. The flow region was illuminated using a high-power LED backlight, as shown in Fig. 1 , instead of the laser sheet used in the smoke visualization and velocimetry. Additionally, a small depth of focus (DoF) corresponding to a small value of lens aperture was used to generate a thin volume where the droplets can be clearly identified. There were no droplets captured by our camera for dry coughing; therefore, the volunteer drank some water to moisten their throat and kept little water in their mouth. The remaining water in their mouth was driven by the pressure of coughing and generated many droplets due to hydrodynamic instability (Scharfman et al., 2016; Mittal et al., 2020b) .

To estimate a droplet's velocity, the location of the droplet had to be detected first. Segmentation methods based on a gray-level or gradient threshold are not appropriate for the droplets because of the intensity variation with the size of the droplets and the refraction of irregular shapes. Additionally, the presence of blurred droplets can locally modify the background around the in-focus droplets (Castanet et al., 2013) . In the present work, the processes for droplet detection are given in Fig Castanet et al. (2013) . The droplet is in the region where the Laplacian is negative. The Gaussian filter size is 7 \u00d7 7 pixels 2 . Second, the connected regions of the image L were computed, corresponding to L \u2264 Lmax. To accurately determine the edges of the droplets, pixels with a negative Laplacian value (\u22120.5 was adopted in practice considering image noise) were connected with the region of L \u2264 Lmax to generate a complete droplet. The value of Lmax was set to \u221210 in this study, and then regions that were too large or too small were excluded. Figure 2 (c) shows the resulting region of connection. Third, a contour operation was applied to the binary image of the connected regions to find the edge of the droplets (Castanet et al., 2013) , and the geometric center of this region was calculated as the location of the droplet. In Fig. 2(d) , the gray contour lines present good agreement with the edges of droplets and the red dots represent the locations of the droplets. Note that a few droplets present a crescent shape due to light refraction.",

The normalized velocity profiles agree well with the blue curve when y/b 1/2 \u2264 0, while velocity when y/b 1/2 > 0 is higher than the blue curve. This asymmetric axial velocity profile may be due to two possible reasons. First, the temperature of the expelled airflow is higher than that of the outside environment, which can cause the airflow to be driven by buoyancy (Bourouiba et al., 2014) .

The height of mouth from the ground is set to 1.8 m. The calculation is performed until the diameter is less than 5 \u03bcm. The Brownian motion is ignored because it comes into play when the diameter of particles is less than 1 \u03bcm (Gensdarmes, 2015) . Additionally, the temperature variation of a droplet is neglected in this work. This physical model is validated by comparing it with other experimental and numerical results in the Appendix, with the resulting error being relatively small and acceptable. Figure 11 displays the trajectories of droplets at five different diameters of D = 30 \u03bcm, 80 \u03bcm, 200 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, and 800 \u03bcm. The simulated results considering the cough airflow and evaporation are shown in Fig. 11(b) . For comparison, only gravity and the drag force are considered in Fig. 11(a) . The initial horizontal velocity of the droplets is 6 m/s. It can be seen from Fig. 11(a) that the horizontal velocity rapidly decreases to zero for the small droplet due to its relatively high viscosity. All the droplets fall to the ground, and the distance from the cougher increases with the increasing diameter. However, considering the real physical process, there are three different types of trajectories, as shown in Fig. 11(b) . First, the trajectory for a droplet of D = 30 \u03bcm stops in the region of the cough airflow, which is denoted region A. The diameter of this droplet decreases to 5 \u03bcm due to evaporation. Second, the trajectory for a droplet of D = 80 \u03bcm stops in the region of ambient air, which is denoted region B. Third, droplets with larger diameters of D = 200 \u03bcm, 400 \u03bcm, and 800 \u03bcm fall to the ground before evaporating to droplet nuclei. Moreover, the droplets in Fig. 11 (b) travel longer distances than those in Fig. 11(a) . Taking D = 200 \u03bcm as an example, the cough airflow can increase the distance from 0.25 m to 0.7 m.",

Measurements including the seasonal variations in the temperature and relative humidity of indoor and outdoor conditions are given by Frankel et al. (2012) . The median values of the temperature and relative humidity measured during summer and winter are listed in Table II . Substituting these parameters into our model, we can obtain the evaporation-falling time curves of the droplets under different weather conditions. The results for an initial droplet velocity of 6 m/s are shown in Fig. 13 . The curves of the summer-outdoor, summer-indoor, and winter-indoor areas almost overlap each other due to their similar temperatures and relative humidities. However, for winter-outdoor conditions, droplets with initial diameters larger than 50 \u03bcm evaporate slowly and deposit on the ground before drying. Additionally, the settling time of droplets with diameters of 50 \u03bcm-100 \u03bcm is much longer than those in the other three cases. If we consider the effect of condensation in winter, more large droplets are slowly settling to the ground in these conditions. This finding indicates that low temperature and high relative humidity may significantly increase the possibility of large droplet transmission and contact transmission, which may be a potential reason for a second pandemic wave in the autumn and winter seasons (Dbouk and Drikakis, 2020c) .",

For flow visualization and PIV, image sequences of cigarette smoke expelled by healthy adult male volunteers were recorded using a high-speed camera. For PSTV, large droplets were recorded using a shadow imaging technique, and the velocity and diameter of these droplets were extracted from the images by tracking the motion of the droplets. Our key findings from the experiments are as follows. First, the visualization shows that the cough jet interacts with the ambient air via flow entrainment, which leads to increasing size and decreasing velocity with the increasing distance from the cougher (Bourouiba et al., 2014) . Further quantitative analysis indicates that the convection velocity of the cough airflow presents the relationship t \u22120.7 with time; hence, the distance from the cougher increases as t 0.3 in the range of our measurement domain. The dependence of the distance s on time t is different from the relationship s \u223c t 0.5 that was obtained by considering a cough as a continuous jet by Bourouiba et al. (2014) . The width of the cough airflow evolves linearly as the distance increases. Second, the normalized mean velocity profile agrees well with that of a synthetic jet in the region y/b 1/2 \u2264 0 and is higher than that of a synthetic jet in the region y/b 1/2 > 0, mainly due to the buoyancy driven by the relatively high temperature of a cough. The maximum airflow can reach 15.0 m/s. Third, the measured minimum diameter is \u223c250 \u03bcm due to the limitations of our experimental hardware. The mean velocity of the droplets is \u223c6.0 m/s, and smaller droplets are more susceptible to cough airflow.",

Our findings indicate that there are two critical sizes for the expelled droplets. The first critical droplet size, where droplets larger than this size fall to the ground or otherwise evaporate to droplet nuclei, is \u223c100 \u03bcm. The second critical droplet size, which distinguishes droplet evaporation in the region of cough airflow from that in the region of ambient air, is \u223c50 \u03bcm. Droplets smaller than 50 \u03bcm are easier for people of the same height to inhale, resulting in a higher probability of infection. Additionally, both the small droplets (initial diameter D \u2264 100 \u03bcm) evaporating to droplet nuclei and the large droplets with D \u2265 500 \u03bcm and initial velocity u 0 \u2265 5 m/s can travel more than the social distance of 2 m. With this model, we also investigated the effects of weather conditions on the evaporation of cough droplets. Winter conditions, with low temperature and high relative humidity, can result in more droplets suspending in the air and settling to the ground, which may be a possible driver of a second pandemic wave in the autumn and winter seasons.",

We should take precautions against a second COVID-19 wave due to the winter conditions of low temperature and high relative humidity. A potential future study is to build a relationship between pandemic evolution and the motion of respiratory droplets to accurately predict the infection rate and range for the population. droplet are bound to their neighbors by intermolecular forces; however, the liquid molecules at the interface are more weakly bounded to their neighbors than those inside the liquid due to having fewer adjacent molecules (Holterman, 2003) . Therefore, some molecules with relatively high kinetic energy escape from the droplet into the air, and a very thin evaporating film with a saturated vapor is generated at the interface between the droplet and air. Because escaped molecules can absorb heat, the droplet's temperature is lower than the temperature of the ambient air T\u221e. In this work, we ignore the variation in the temperature of the droplet and assume that the final droplet temperature is the wet-bulb temperature Tw, which can be described by a linear relation with T\u221e and quadratic relation with relative humidity RH as (Holterman, 2003) Tw At 100% relative humidity, the wet-bulb temperature Tw is equal to the air temperature T\u221e (dry-bulb temperature). If the air is saturated with the water vapor, the partial vapor pressure is defined as the saturated vapor pressure psat. psat is strongly dependent on the temperature, and an empirical equation is given as (Holterman, 2003) psat = 610.7 \u00d7 10 7.5T/(T+237.3) .",

The variation in the velocity qualitatively agrees with the results given by Gupta et al. (2009), Dudalski et al. (2020), and Kwon et al. (2012). However, Dudalski et al. (2020) reported that the peak velocity value is \u223c22.0 m/s at t = 0.068 s, which is different from the present result. A potential reason for the difference is that the position of the mouth and the onset time of coughing are slightly different among the volunteers in our experiments. These uncertainties are difficult to avoid under the current experimental conditions.
