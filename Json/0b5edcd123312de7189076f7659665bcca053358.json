All confirmed patients were diagnosed by symptoms and radiological findings plus positive laboratory results. A confirmed case with COVID-19 was defined as a positive result to high-throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay for nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. Only the laboratory-confirmed cases were included in the analysis. Epidemiological data, symptoms at presentation, presence of comorbidities, laboratory data, treatment regimens, and clinical outcomes were collected from electronic medical records using a standardized data collection form. The frequency of examinations was determined by the treating physician. All recruited patients received the computed tomography scan. Hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 were followed up to March 25, 2020. All data were checked by two physicians (CF and CD) and a third researcher (XF) adjudicated any difference in interpretation between the two primary reviewers. This study was approved by the ethics commissions of Wuhan Integrated TCM & Western Medicine Hospital (ID number: MEC[2020]No.8) and informed consent was obtained from patients involved before enrollment.",

Meanwhile, the incidence of coronary heart disease in hemodialysis patients in the death group was higher than that in the survival group(55.6% vs. 20.8%, p < .05, Table 2 ). No significant difference in age, gender, dialysis age, primary kidney disease, average blood pressure, KT/V, and type of angioaccess was found between the two groups ( Table 2) . However, patients in the death group had more prominent laboratory abnormalities than those in the survival group, such as leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein levels, extended PT time, and elevated D-dimer level (all p < .05, Table 3 ). Meanwhile, hepatocyte damage was significantly more severe in the death group than that in the survival group (i.e. higher level of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, lower level of albumin, all p < .05, Table 3 ). In terms of cardiomyocyte damage, no significant difference was found in creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB) level between the two groups. However, the level of cardiac troponin-I was higher in the death group than that in the survival group (0.572(IQR 0.020, 0.173) vs. 0.071(IQR 0.063, 0. 730), p \u00bc .002, Table 3 ). Further logistic regression analysis suggested that fever, dyspnea, elevated D-dimer level Table 4 ). Almost all hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 had characteristic CT features in the disease process, such as different degrees of ground-glass opacities, multifocal organizing pneumonia, and architectural distortion in a peripheral distribution, but the positive chest CT findings in the death group were more severe than that in the survival group at the beginning of disease (Table 3 ; Figure 1 ). According to the semi-quantitative scoring system, the total scores of lung involvement in the death group was greater than that in the survival group ( 6 \u00b1 4 vs. 2 \u00b1 2; p \u00bc .021) ( Table 3) . Among the deceased hemodialysis patients, respiratory and heart failure were numerous. Severe complications observed in death group included acute respiratory distress syndrome (9/18; 50.0%), respiratory failure (12/18; 66.7%), acute cardiac injury (12/18; 66.7%), heart failure (15/18; 83.3%), and shock (6/18; 33.3%). These were significantly more frequent than in the survival group, showing their potential association with the clinical outcome. Less common complications in death group included sepsis (2/18; 11.1%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (1/18; 5.6%), acute liver injury ( .007",

The dialysate flow rate was fixed at 500 mL/min, and ultrafiltration rates were set according to individual needs. The single pool urea kinetic model was monitored to ensure a delivered dialysis dose of at least 1.2 per dialysis for thrice weekly sessions. The clinical data were collected from 66 hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 in our center. According to different prognosis, they were divided into the survival group and death group. Compared with the survival group, a higher incidence of fever and dyspnea was presented in the death group. Meanwhile, patients in the death group were often accompanied by higher white blood cell count, prolonged PT time, increased D-dimer. More patients in the death group showed hepatocytes and cardiomyocytes damage.

Although the prevalence of fever in the death group is much higher than that in the survival group and may be related to the prognosis. Second, in another singlecenter case series of 138 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, it was observed that patients admitted to the intensive care unit were older and had more complications than non-ICU patients [12] . Another clinical research also suggested that older age and higher Ddimer might be potential risk factors of poor prognosis at an early stage of disease [13] . But in our observation, unlike non-dialysis patients, no significant difference in age was found between the death group and the survival group. The logistic regression analysis suggested that no correlation between the age and death risk of hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Therefore, even young hemodialysis patients should be highly vigilant if they develop fever and dyspnea at the beginning of disease.

The mortality rate of COVID-19 in our center surpassed the overall mortality rate in Wuhan (nearly 5.1%, 2574/50008). The median time from diagnosis to death in hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 was very short. In the early stage of the disease outbreak, especially from January 27 to February 6, the number of COVID-19 patients increased rapidly, but the Huoshenshan hospital and cabin hospitals were still under construction. Consequently, medical resources such as the ICU ward and medical staff, high flow nasal cannula oxygen ventilator, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were in shortage at Wuhan during that time. On the other hand, some family members of elderly patients refused invasive rescue treatments according to their own wishes. Besides, some hemodialysis patients with COVID-19 quickly developed severe complications such as cardiac arrest, hypotensive shock because of viral virulence and cardiovascular co-existing orders. These patients often died before invasive rescue treatment was given. Therefore, the shortage of medical resources, the wishes of family members, and time constraints might lead to a higher mortality rate than the general population in our center. After February 15th, a large number of mobile cabin hospitals were put into use, the specialized hospitals such as Huoshenshan, Leishenshan, and Jinyintan hospital were in good operation, and ICU medical staff across the country rushed to help. These measures have effectively reduced the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients, including hemodialysis patients with COVID-19.",
