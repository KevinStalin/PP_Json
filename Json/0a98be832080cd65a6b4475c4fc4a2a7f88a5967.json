Some scholars have noted that this 'infodemic'-as WHO called it-has already resulted in considerable harm. [1] [2] [3] [4] Specifically, this infodemic is associated with deaths, delayed treatment, wasted resources and substantive concerns that it adds to an already confused and chaotic information environment. [5] [6] [7] Boosting the immune system is a common theme associated with many of the products and practices presented as strategies to avoid or help fight COVID-19. Indeed, a Google Trends analysis reveals that searches for phrases like 'immune boost' and 'immune boosting' spiked in early February, 2020, as concern about the impact of the virus started to intensify. However, the concept of immune boosting is misleading and scientifically inaccurate. 8 9 The immune system is fantastically complex, and researchers are still exploring how various nutrients impact its performance, with overly active immune systems potentially leading to autoimmune diseases and anaphylaxis. Some early research studies have also suggested that an exaggerated immune response is implicated in respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. 10 There is no evidence that any product or practiceaside from a vaccine-will provide extra or enhanced 'immune boosting' protection against Despite this reality, celebrities, wellness gurus and supplement companies have Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The study includes a large dataset of webpages that appear in Google searches in Canada and the USA during a critical period in the pandemic. \u25ba Data analysis identifies and characterises a common coronavirus-related prevention strategy in a range of online contexts. \u25ba Inter-rater reliability of coding was high with strong to almost perfect agreement. \u25ba Dataset represented English-language webpages only based on a specific query conducted at two points in time in two regions. \u25ba Internet protocol (IP) address masking was not possible and some localised results may have appeared in search results for the two regions.",

Additionally, there is some evidence that the kinds of COVID-19 information that people are exposed to affects their health-related behaviours and attitudes. 14 15 As such, the different public responses to the pandemic in Canada and the USA warrant further exploration of how misinformation may impact on perceptions of how to prevent and protect against COVID-19. 16 17 This study, therefore, focuses on how immune boosting and supplements are being portrayed with respect to COVID-19 in Canada and the USA.",

To limit personalisation of the search results, we did not link the browser to an existing Google account, and we deleted cookies and erased the browser history. We conducted advanced searches, which allowed us to select regional settings. We first conducted a search with the region set to Canada, then deleted all cookies and erased the browsing history, and conducted the same search the region set to the USA. We transferred the URLs from each search result to an Microsoft Excel spread sheet, noting the country and result number. Google Chrome automatically omits similar results, so we collected all of the URLs for each search until we reached the automatically generated message 'In order to show you the most relevant results, we have omitted some entries very similar to the [#] already displayed. If you like, you can repeat the search with the omitted results included.' After, visiting and reading each webpage, we excluded 35 URLs because they were irrelevant (ie, not about immune boosting and/or coronavirus), behind a paywall, or inaccessible (ie, broken links). The resulting data set consisted of 227 webpages.",

We first coded the typology of the websites in which the webpages appeared using a modified version of Cassa Macedo et al's typology (see online supplemental table A). 18 Webpages were then coded for how immune boosting and supplements were portrayed, whether an immune boosting product or service was being sold or advertised on the webpage, and whether the microbiome or gut health was mentioned. For webpages that portrayed immune boosting as beneficial to preventing COVID-19, we recorded the suggested immune boosting strategies, that is, the actions people can take to boost their immune systems. Webpages that suggested taking vitamins and minerals (eg, vitamin C, zinc) through food and/or supplements were coded for those specific vitamins or minerals, not food or supplement. Similarly, we recorded an immune boosting strategy as 'supplements and vitamins' when the webpage made a general reference to these types of products or in reference to taking a multivitamin or supplement with multiple immune boosting ingredients.",

For example, one webpage states, \"Yoghurt is considered a probiotic that is essential to your immune system's health. It directly affects your gut, helping the good bacteria to thrive. Your gut health is directly associated with your immune system. Therefore, a healthy gut means a healthy immune system.\" 28 To assess the degree to which different types of webpages represent the concept of immune boosting, we compared website typology with the portrayal of immune boosting and supplements, mention of the microbiome or gut health, and whether the webpage was selling or advertising an immune boosting product or service. We focused on news and commercial websites given their prevalence in the dataset and due to low case counts for the other types of websites. Commercial webpages were ",

In comparison to previous studies that find a large presence of commercial websites, 18 29 less than a quarter of the websites in our dataset (24.7%) are commercial, and only 20% of webpages were selling a specific immune boosting product or service. It is possible that Google may have modified their search rank algorithms during the pandemic to foreground established media sources and institutions over commercial discourse, but to our knowledge there has been no official statement from Google addressing this. However, 40% of webpages portrayed supplements, such as vitamins, as beneficial for boosting immunity, which indirectly supports a hugely popular multibillion dollar industry [30] [31] [32] with largely no scientific basis to support the 'immune boost' claim. 8 9 Similarly, while others found that commercial websites were somewhat hidden further down in search results, 18 28 there were only minor variations in the types of websites and how the webpages portrayed immune boosting and supplements between the whole data set and the webpages that appeared in the top 20 of search results.",

Eating a balanced diet, getting sufficient sleep, exercising regularly and reducing one's stress levels are well known to be strategies for maintaining health under any circumstances. However, the explanations from webpages for how these strategies prevent COVID-19 are framed as not just for health, but for boosting immunity. This suggests that the concept of 'immune boosting' has taken on a broader meaning and seems to be deployed to attract interest in the products or ideas being put forth. The phrase is now ubiquitous and has likely taken on a 'health halo', 33 not unlike other wellness terms that lack clear definition or health benefits, such as 'natural', or 'gluten-free'. 34 35 The microbiome or gut health were also mentioned as an important part of boosting immunity in 30.8% of the webpages. This is an example of using the rhetoric around an emerging area of science to legitimise unproven approaches to health-a tactic that has been deployed in other contexts. 36 37 The reification of the phrase 'immune boosting' when paired with solid advice for maintaining one's health (eg, healthy diet, exercise, sleep) and with language from genuine areas of science, such as microbiome research, may inadvertently help to legitimise the concept, making it a more potent marketing tool. Diet, sleep, and exercise are among the top five strategies suggested in commercial webpages and the microbiome is mentioned in 39.3% of commercial webpages, which means that immune boosting strategies that lack evidence are often Open access described on par, or in association, with sound advice for maintaining health with little to indicate the difference to readers. This framing forms one of the core kinds of misinformation portrayed by the immune boosting narrative. It is often an implied, rather than explicit, form of misinformation-where the context and associations to other health actions or relevant science suggest efficacy and benefit. Perhaps more troubling are the advertisements of products and services intertwined within this immune boosting narrative. Policy responses-including regulatory action-will need to grapple with these less overt forms of health misinformation.",

It is unknown, for example, whether large numbers of the North American public have felt that strengthening their immune system has allowed them to participate in less social distancing. Further research is required on the impact of immune boosting messages on public perceptions and subsequent health-related behaviours. Also unclear is whether immune boosting ideas have clashed with the messaging from public health experts.
