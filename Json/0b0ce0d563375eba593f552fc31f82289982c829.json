As seen elsewhere, influenza viruses were a major contributor (16%) to viral respiratory infections associated with SARI.

Although children <5 years of age accounted for only a small proportion of our population (5\u00c15%), they were more likely to test positive for viral infections than other age groups, and most of their infections were due to RSV, which is the most common cause of acute respiratory infections in children globally. 11 Few SARI surveillance systems in other countries tested for viral pathogens other than influenza, and those that do often focused on children <5 years old. [12] [13] [14] The overall detection rate of viral pathogens among hospitalized SARI cases aged <5 years in our surveillance (82%) was lower than in China (94% in <72 months) 14 and higher than in Kenya (71%) or in Bangladesh (52%). 11, 12 The proportion of SARI cases that were positive for RSV in children <5 years in our surveillance (31%) was similar to surveillance data in Bangladesh (37%) and slightly higher than in Kenya (21%).

First, our selection of large, referral hospitals likely biased our sample to more severe cases presenting later in the course of illness. Further, two of the six hospitals in Southern Arizona that were not included may be more likely to see mobile populations as they are physically closer to border. Although the surveillance was intended to be comprehensive within the selected hospitals, it might not have captured all SARI cases that presented at the hospital. Some cases may have not been enrolled due to doctors' omission or patients' admission without passing through the emergency ward. Additionally, few children <5 years were enrolled as our sites are not major providers of pediatric care in Southern Arizona. This population might not be representative of the population of Southern Arizona, and its age distribution may underestimate the burden of SARI, especially among children. Also, because we collected information on mortality at the hospital, deaths that occurred in patients discharged to hospices or nursing homes for terminal care were not included. However, we are in the process of analyzing death certificate data to identify deaths associated with the hospitalization in order to get a better understanding of the predictors of mortality and the mortality burden associated with SARI in Southern Arizona.
