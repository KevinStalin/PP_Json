[7] [8] [9] Although similar outcomes have not been confirmed in COVID-19, these historical lessons call for an immediate understanding of this disease in pregnancy, including clinical presentations, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and possible therapeutic interventions. Herein, we aim to review the published literature with a specific focus on clinical presentations among pregnant women afflicted with COVID-19.",

Multiple strategies have been proposed for the screening and testing of COVID-19, as the understanding of the at-risk population evolved from recent travelers to asymptomatic community spread. As a result, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed guidelines to assist in triaging patients with suspected COVID-19. These statements encourage clinicians to prioritize testing in high risk populations while considering epidemiologic factors that may increase a patient\"s a priori risk for the disease. 11 Furthermore, ACOG recognizes the potential for asymptomatic patients presenting to labor and delivery units and implores clinicians to consider additional strategies as appropriate. 12 Consistent with the guidance put forth by the CDC and ACOG, certain institutions based in geographic regions with higher COVID-19 disease prevalence have opted for universal testing of patients admitted to labor and delivery by via SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR. 13 At many New York City institutions, which are considered to be within an epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic due to high case burden, implementation of universal testing via SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal PCR has helped to provide a fuller understanding of the variable COVID-19 patient presentations that are possible among pregnant women. 14, 15 ",

Neurological manifestations including anosmia, hypogeusia, and impaired consciousness have also been described.

Therefore, special precaution should be taken with fluid resuscitation among pregnant patients. There is additionally an increase in capillary hydrostatic pressure. 52 The combination of these two forces results in extravasation of fluids into the interstitial space in pregnancy. As a result, pregnant patients with AKI and pulmonary injury secondary to SARS-CoV-2 may be at particular risk for pulmonary edema.
