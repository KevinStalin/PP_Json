Main protease (M pro ) of this virus is a highly attractive drug target among various other enzymes due to its ability to process poly-protein that is the translated product of the SARS-CoV2 RNA. The aim of the present study demonstrates molecular docking study of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Gg) active compounds such as Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), Liquiritigenin (L) and Glabridin (G) against the M pro . Docking studies shows that these active compounds bind strongly with some of the amino acid residues in the active site of M pro and inhibits the enzyme strongly. GA, L, and G are proposed to be strong inhibitors of the enzyme and the amino acids: His 41 , Gly 143 , Gln 189 , Glu 166 , Cys 145 , Thr 25 , Asn 142 , Met 49 , Cys 44 , Thr 45 and pro 168 present in the active site of M pro were shown to make non-covalent interaction with these compounds. In silico ADMET properties prediction also shows that Gg active compounds had good solubility, absorption, permeation, non-toxic, and non-carcinogenic characteristics. Our finding concludes that all of the three active compounds of Gg could have the potential to be strong inhibitors for M pro of SARS-CoV2 but glycyrrhizic acid have a high binding affinity of -8.0 Kcal/mol and glycyrrhizic acid have good ADMET properties than the other two.",

SARS-CoV [3] , MERS-CoV [4] and SARS-CoV2 [5] are the three category of coronavirus that causes the deadly pneumonia in humans. Severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV2) is an enveloped, positive-sense single-strand RNA placed in a beta coronavirus family of Coronaviridae [6] . As compared to the other two, SARS-CoV2 is highly contagious and spread the infection more quickly and severely, leading to large number of deaths and thus arising a pandemic situation [7, 8] .",

The recently proposed drugs targets the main protease (M pro also known as 3CL pro ) which is one of the best targets among the other enzymes in the virus [10] . This enzyme participates in the processing of polyprotein that is translated from the RNA of the same virus [11] . These polyprotein are processed and converted into mature non-structural proteins using two proteases PL pro and CL pro encoded by ORF1 (open reading frame1) [12] . A nonstructural protein of coronavirus plays a significant role in replication and transcription during the infection [13] . Main protease operates at more than 10 cleavage sites on the polyprotein 1ab which is nearly 790 kDa [14] . M pro is a homodimer having two identical chains and the recognition sequence is Leu-Gln \u2193 Ser, Ala, Gly and cleaved through the Cys-His dyad protease in which -SH group of cysteine serve as a nucleophile in the proteolysis [15] . Inhibiting the main protease activity would block transcription or replication. The amino acid residues of the active site of M pro participating in substrate binding includes Cys145 -His41 dyad ,and Phe140, Thr45, Arg188, Asp187, Met49, Asn142, Met165, Gln189, His172, Glu166 [16] . An enormous amount of data is available for describing the efficiency of an array of various active components of medicinal plants effective against the viruses. Among these medicinal plant, Glycyrrhiza glabra is the one plant, its active compounds may have the potential to act against various viruses [17] . Glycyrrhiza glabra (Gg) commonly called 'sweet wood' and 'liquorice' belongs to the family. It has been effective against many RNA viruses like H5N1virus, Hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus, Newcastle disease virus, H1N1 virus, Rotavirus, severe acute respiratory virus etc. and DNA viruses such as Varicella Zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus and Herpes Simplex virus etc. [18] .",

It provides drug relevant information whenever a structure is valid and underlines various properties with a high risk of inadmissible effects such as poor intestinal absorption, mutagenicity or drug conform behaviour through different customization characteristics. This also determines the clog P (Logarithm of compounds partition coefficient between water and n-Octanol) which determines the hydrophilicity of the compounds. Larger the clog P value, lower the hydrophilicity and thus poor the permeation and absorption. Log S suggest solubility; lower the log S value, higher the solubility which enhances the absorption. The Topological polar surface area (TPSA) suggest the surfaces that belong to the polar atoms and molecules in the compound. Larger TPSA value is related with the least permeability of the membrane. The compounds that have larger TPSA value will be a better substrate for p-glycoprotein which is liable for efflux of drug from the cell and thus reduced TPSA was beneficial for drug-like property.

L shows maximum solubility in the blood. TPSA of GA is also higher as compared with the other two compounds which tell the efficiency of the compounds in terms of membrane permeability.

Higher human intestinal absorption indicates that the compound of interest may be better consumed from the gastrointestinal tract upon oral administration. The penetration through the Blood-Brain Barrier is computed to be the best for G and comparatively higher than L and almost similar to GA. In terms of predicting the efflux by P-glycoprotein from the cell, GA comes out to be inhibitor and non-substrate of P-glycoprotein, G comes out to be non-inhibitor and substrate and L comes out to be noninhibitor and non-substrate. An inhibitor of P-glycoprotein means that drug will inhibit the efflux process from the cell and enhances the bioavailability and non-inhibitor of P-glycoprotein mean that drug will efflux from the cell by P-glycoprotein and limits the bioavailability by pumping back into the lumen and may promote the elimination of that drug into the bile and urine [34] . In the case of metabolism, GA and G found to be non-inhibitor and substrate while L found to be inhibitor and non-substrate. A non-inhibitor of cytochrome P450 means that the molecule will not hinder the biotransformation of the compound (drug) metabolized by cytochrome P450 [31] . The Carcinogenic profile also shows that GA, G, and L are non-carcinogenic so it can be applied as drugs for treating COVID-19 as there would not be any bioaccumulation of compounds in the human body and these compounds would not lead to cancer in future if the patient is treated for a long duration. Acute oral toxicity was found to be higher in G followed by GA and L. It shows that L has less oral toxicity than GA which further suggests that the drugs L are not metabolized in the gastrointestinal tract before reaching the desired target. All these results have also been depicted in the form of a graph (figure 8 A, B and table 4).",

Molecular docking indicated that the three active compounds of Glycyrrhiza glabra namely glycyrrhizic acid, Liquiritigenin, and Glabridin successfully docked with the amino acid molecule at the catalytic site of the M pro with a high negative binding affinity and formed several molecular interaction with the main protease of SARS-CoV2. They may form a complex with the M pro of SARS-CoV2 causing inhibition of the catalytic activity of the main protease. His 41 and Cys 145 are conserved amino acids found in different types of coronavirus family and also plays a crucial role in enzyme catalysis and our docking result also showed that His 41 and Cys 145 are participated in the non-covalent interaction with all the three active compounds of Glycyrrhiza glabra. So from this study it is concluded that these active compounds exactly occupy the same location and binds these amino acid residues of the enzyme which otherwise would occupied by the natural substrates for the enzyme (M pro ), so these compounds can be replaced as a proposed drug for the main protease of SARS-COV2. admetSAR results acknowledge that glycyrrhizic acid would be more suitable drug candidate among the other two compounds as it is more selective, potent, non-carcinogenic, and non-tumorigenic. OSIRIS Property explorer had shown Glabridin to have toxicity to the reproductive system and Liquiritigenin to be mutagenic and hence proved to be a less good drug candidate than glycyrrhizic acid. The outbreak of SARS-CoV2 in December 2019 having no antiviral drug attainable for instant relief in the initial stage, this computational study may provide some promise for the designing of new antiviral drugs with least side effect and more target oriented. Our result will be further supported and validated with in vitro and in vivo studies experiments which will be the our future prospects. ",
