            "text": "There has been some research conducted regarding nurses' career success aimed at exploring its influencing factors, but there is no research on the mechanism of selfidentity on the career success of infection control nurses. In order to further explore the formation mechanism of career success of nurses, we conducted our study using the Kaleidoscope Career Model to explore the chain-mediating effects of cognitive emotion regulation and social support between self-identity and career success. Five hundred forty-seven infection control nurses from nine different hospitals participated in the study and completed questionnaires on the self-identity, cognitive emotion regulation, social support, and career success scales. The results from structural equation modeling reveal that self-identity has a positive effect on positive emotion regulation and social support and a negative impact on negative emotion regulation. Positive (negative) emotion regulation has a positive (negative) effect on social support. All antecedents have a positive impact on career success except negative emotion regulation, which has a negative one. Bootstrap analysis shows that the relationship between self-identity and career success is partially mediated by the chain of cognitive emotion regulation and social support. Overall, our research sheds light on the mechanism of self-identity on career success of nurses. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

Nowadays, as different strains of infectious diseases emerge with their own resistance profiles, medical professionals face unprecedented challenges (Musau et al., 2015) . As a special profession, infection control nurses who specialize in preventing and treating infectious diseases need to master more medical knowledge and strict operating procedures for self-protection than other nurses (Stirling et al., 2004) . They not only treat infectious patients, but also predict infectious diseases and report to the public in a timely manner (El-Bahnasawy et al., 2014; Wood et al., 2019) . They play an important role in infectious disease work, and improving their career success is a significant issue. A sense of career success is the realization of an individual's positive psychological satisfaction and self value, which is conducive to the improvement of work quality and efficiency (Robinson et al., 2016; Cumbler et al., 2018) . Therefore, improving the career success of infectious disease nurses is of great importance and is helpful to promote the development of infectious disease nursing and public health.",

Achieving career success is defined as developing individual potential, meeting the satisfaction of growth needs, and realizing individual selfvalue (Woolston, 2019) . Previous research on the career success of nurses mainly focused on either objective factors (Dan et al., 2018) or internally and externally driven factors . Among these, self-identity is an important psychological factor actively affecting career success (Arrowsmith et al., 2016) . The sense of self-identity is a person's degree of selfcognition, which is a synthesis of individual inner feelings, self-consciousness, and external evaluation (Meijer et al., 2018) . Scholars and practitioners have increasingly urged the need for nurses to strengthen self-identity in recent years (Brown et al., 2006; Tai, 2011; ten Hoeve et al., 2014; Peterson, 2016) . It is an important factor in achieving career success (Dan et al., 2018) in that individuals with good self-identity have clear life goals, experience self-worth, and gain either social recognition or approval in the process of pursuing their goals (Werner and Hochman, 2019) . They are always energetic and active, which is conducive to the completion of work tasks and the realization of work objectives .",

(2019) , the concept of emotion regulation can be regarded as a cognitive way to manage the intake of emotionally arousing information that has an impact on the higher cognitive activities of reasoning, decision making, and so on. Emerging research suggests that the development of self-identity is also closely related to cognitive emotion regulation in that good self-identity can help individuals choose positive emotion regulation strategies and avoid negative ones (Dereboy et al., 2018; Southward and Cheavens, 2018) . Social support refers to the help that individuals get from the outside . Indeed, previous research has reported that self-identity is also related to social support (Youngkeun, 2020) in that individuals with a good sense of self-identity often have better psychological makeup and harmonious interpersonal relationships, which is conducive to mobilizing the available resources around them (Werner and Hochman, 2019) , are they are more likely to seek help from outside. An 8-month study of nurses in Australia showed that self-identity was effective in predicting social support through work (Merrick et al., 2012) .",

Positive emotion regulation strategies can promote good psychological adaptability and positive coping and actively seeking help from the outside world (Bamonti et al., 2019; Young et al., 2019) , which is consistent with d' Arbeloff 's research (d'Arbeloff et al., 2018) that cognitive emotion regulation is significantly related to social support, and good social support can successfully regulate negative cognitive emotion. Good selfidentity can regulate the cognitive emotion strategy (Sharma et al., 2018) , and individuals with good self-identity tend to choose the positive cognitive emotion strategy, which is helpful to get help and social support from outside. Social support is an important factor for improving the psychosocial work environment and fostering a positive work climate and is conducive to the acquisition of career achievement (Johnsen et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2018) . A good social support system can help nurses to prevent the onset of work-related stress, resolve work difficulties, and provide career planning, which is an important factor for nurses' career development and success (Al-Hussami et al., 2018; Southward and Cheavens, 2018) .",

It asserts that career success is mainly composed of three factors: authenticity, challenge, and balance (Lisa et al., 2018) : (1) Authenticity is the parameter that describes being genuine and true to oneself, knowing one's strengths and limitations, having a correct examination of oneself. In our study, we used self-identity to reflect this parameter. (2) Challenge as a driving force is an indispensable factor in career development. Individuals who focus on challenge often hold themselves to a higher standard. Taking different measures to deal with challenges or difficulties may be a greater challenge for individuals and can have an important impact on career success. In our study, it is a challenge for nurses to choose different cognitive emotion regulation strategies in clinical work.",

Structural equation modeling has a sample size requirement. When the number of entries is too large, more parameters need to be estimated by SEM. If the sample size is small, large parameter bias may be produced by using the original items. Item parceling can improve the communalities and reduce random error, which is an effective method to solve this problem (McDonald and Ho, 2002) . We packed 19 items of SIS into three packages according to the item packing method of high to low strategies (Cho and Kang, 2007) .

Self-identity had a significant positive impact on positive cognitive emotion regulation (\u03b2 = 0.129, SE = 6.588, p = 0.000) and indirectly affected social support (\u03b2 = 0.392, SE = 3.661, p = 0.000) and career success (\u03b2 = 0.363, SE = 3.310, p = 0.001). Self-identity had a significant negative impact on negative cognitive emotion regulation (\u03b2 = \u22120.290, SE = \u22129.226, p = 0.000) and indirectly affects social support (\u03b2 = \u22120.236, SE = \u22122.478, p < 0.05) and career success (\u03b2 = 0.363, SE = 3.310, p = 0.001). Self-identity was positively related to career success (\u03b2 = 0.251, SE = 2.736, p < 0.01). The total indirect effect accounted for 44.28% of the total effect of selfidentity on career success (total effect = 0.542, total indirect effect = 0.240, R 2 = 0.394). Table 2 shows the confidence interval of mediating effect value in the chain-mediated model. The results show that the path from self-identity to career success through social support is significant. Confidence intervals are 95% (0.066, 0.272), which did not contain 0, indicating that the chain-mediating effects were significant. The path from self-identity to career success through the chains of positive/negative cognitive emotion regulation and social support are significant. Confidence intervals are 95% (0.001, 0.049) and (0.002, 0.035). However, the other paths are not significant. The total mediating effect value was 0.199, p < 0.01, and the 95% CI (0.073, 0.326) did not contain 0, indicating that the total mediating effect was significant. The specific path model diagram is shown in Figure 1 .",

Cognitive emotion regulation and social support as a chain structure mediate the relationship between self-identity and career success.

            "text": "In Figure 2 , the SEM shows that self-identity has a positive (negative) effect on positive (negative) emotion regulation, which has a positive and negative effect on social support. Cognitive emotion regulation refers to the cognitive coping strategies taken by individuals in dealing with events (Qiao et al., 2016; Loechner et al., 2020) . Our study is consistent with the results of Cai et al. (2017) who find that positive (negative) cognitive emotion regulation is positively (negatively) correlated with social support. When individuals adopt positive emotion regulation strategies, they seek help from the outside world by communicating with others to find solutions to their problems (Cano et al., 2020; Loechner et al., 2020) . When individuals adopt negative emotion regulation strategies, they experience selfclosure, which prevents them from seeking out social support. The chain intermediary model proves that, when individuals have a high sense of self-identity, they view themselves positively and always adopt positive cognitive emotion regulation strategies to seek help and social support when they encounter negative events; they are more likely to experience career success while negative cognitive emotion regulation is not conducive to social support and plays a negative predictive role in career success. Infection control nurses regularly face dangerous and infectious diseases, high risk of occupational exposure, and risk of infection (Jin et al., 2020) . The demanding nature of infection control work makes these nurses experience greater psychological pressure (Qiao et al., 2016) . The significance of an individual's career success helps them to realize its value and play a corresponding role in the post (Robinson et al., 2016) . Compared to other nurses, they should have better self-identity, believe that they can be competent for the post responsibilities, handle the work well, and do a good job in disease care. Therefore, to study their career success is of great significance to improve the quality of nursing. Nurses and managers should be aware of the chain-mediating role of cognitive emotion regulation and social support between self-identity and professional success, so they can apply it to their professional work. Nurses can learn how to improve self-identity and regulate their emotions through theoretical teaching, and managers can maintain open lines of communication with the nurses to ensure they are emotionally and professionally supported. When infection control nurses encounter negative events in their work, they should learn to seek help from colleagues, leaders, or family members. They can do this by adopting positive cognitive and emotional adjustment strategies. The director of the hospital should pay attention to the self-identity of nurses and give proper encouragement and should also strengthen the support to the nurses, both psychologically and materially. Material support, such as bonus and reward, will mobilize the enthusiasm of the nurses and subsequently promote their professional success. Therefore, their hospitals, family, and friends should also give support and care to infection control nurses.",
