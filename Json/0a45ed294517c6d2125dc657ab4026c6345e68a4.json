            "text": "In 2016, the European Commission launched the EU-ToxRisk research project to develop and promote animal-free approaches in toxicology. The 36 partners of this consortium used in vitro and in silico methods in the context of case studies (CSs). These CSs included both compounds with a highly defined target (e.g. mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors) as well as compounds with poorly defined molecular initiation events (e.g. short-chain branched carboxylic acids). The initial project focus was on developing a science-based strategy for read-across (RAx) as an animal-free approach in chemical risk assessment. Moreover, seamless incorporation of new approach method (NAM) data into this process (= NAM-enhanced RAx) was explored. Here, the EU-ToxRisk consortium has collated its scientific and regulatory learnings from this particular project objective. For all CSs, a mechanistic hypothesis (in the form of an adverse outcome pathway) guided the safety evaluation. ADME data were generated from NAMs and used for comprehensive physiological-based kinetic modelling. Quality assurance and data management were optimized in parallel. Scientific and Regulatory Advisory Boards played a vital role in assessing the practical applicability of the new approaches. In a next step, external stakeholders evaluated the usefulness of NAMs in the context of RAx CSs for regulatory acceptance. For instance, the CSs were included in the OECD CS portfolio for the Integrated Approach to Testing and Assessment project. Feedback from regulators and other stakeholders was collected at several stages. Future chemical safety science projects can draw from this experience to implement systems toxicology-guided, animal-free next-generation risk assessment. M. J. Mon\u00e9 and G. Pallocca contributed equally to this work.",

The project initially focused on read-across (RAx) Rovida et al. 2020a ) and here we outline key outcomes and general learnings on the use of NAMs for RAx. This collection of outputs will facilitate new efforts in next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) (Dent et al. 2018; Dearfield et al. 2017; Cote et al. 2016; Krewski et al. 2014 ) and thus advance the field of safety assessment by more mechanistically driven and animal-free approaches (Suppl. Box 1). This report was assembled once an important project phase came to its conclusion. We will accentuate especially learnings on the regulatory implementation of new approaches. Moreover, we highlight some gaps and unresolved issues that will need future attention.",

RAx may support safety assessment for the complex toxicological endpoints RDT and DART, yet it often fails to be accepted by regulatory agencies. Reasons for rejection often include the notion that associated uncertainties are perceived as being too large. Classical RAx is based on structural similarity as the major argument, and there are many examples that chemical formula alone does not sufficiently predict toxicity. This uncertainty can be substantially reduced when NAMs demonstrate that source and target chemicals share similar biological and toxicokinetic profiles, providing justification for reading across source chemicals' in vivo data.",

Also, the absence of a certain mechanism or effect can be demonstrated, as well as the relatively low potency for a certain testing endpoint. The EU-ToxRisk RAx testing framework demonstrated how NAMs can be integrated into practical RAx procedures .",

If no AOP is known, the battery of NAMs can be chosen in a way to capture as many as possible potential underlying mechanisms. NAMs can alternatively be used for broad untargeted testing to either (1) generate a RAx hypothesis based on shared in vitro effects, or (2) to prove the absence of effects (up to concentrations corresponding or exceeding those obtained in humans under realistic exposure situations).",

The bottom box indicates information that can be provided by NAMs to reduce uncertainty (e.g. data on potency ratios in key event (KE) or molecular initiation event (MIE) assays, or the identification (ID) of relevant metabolites formed) introduce their own uncertainty (assay variations, random noise, and congruence of different tests). This issue can be addressed by applying a structured and weighted description of uncertainties. This may use generalized Bayesian approaches or Dempster-Shafer decision theory (Dempster 1967; Rathman et al. 2018; Shafer 1976) , or it may use semiquantitative approaches based on expert judgment Schultz et al. 2018) . For instance, the Dempster-Shafer approach allows for a fully quantitative combination of various types of test data, taking into account the individual test performances/uncertainties, and to derive likelihoods of test data being correct. EU-ToxRisk puts significant emphasis on diligent uncertainty descriptions and in taking initial steps towards uncertainty quantification. More resources will need to be put in place to apply these concepts in a more routine manner, and the science of uncertainty assessment is likely to become an important support discipline of risk assessment.",

NAM data were subsequently used to better define the boundaries of the categories and to reduce uncertainties.

An AOP-based testing strategy was applied to support the RAx hypothesis. The AOP for inhibition of mitochondrial complex I of nigrostriatal neurons leading to parkinsonian motor deficits (Terron et al. 2018 ) was used to assess the biological similarity of two different rotenoids: rotenone (source compound, data-rich) and deguelin (target compound, data-poor). For the source compound, there was compelling evidence for the induction of Parkinson's-like disorders in experimental models, and also epidemiological evidence for similar effects in human (Ntzani et al. 2013) . Various NAMs were selected to represent the MIE and KEs of the AOP. Both, in silico and in vitro test methods were applied. For instance, in silico structural modelling was used to identify the common pharmacophore that determines the binding to complex I, being the MIE of the AOP. To determine effects on the KEs, several in vitro methods were used to detect effects on mitochondrial respiratory activity (oxygen consumption) and on proteostasis. High-content imaging methods were applied for measuring damage to human dopaminergic neurons, and to compare the effects of the two compounds. Finally, PBK modelling was performed to compare biokinetics and distribution of both compounds to the brain. The approach chosen in this case study demonstrated that an AOP-based testing strategy combining different test methods that cover the various KEs can be applied in supporting chemical safety assessment within a NAM-based RAx framework.",

For this purpose, the project's Scientific Advisory Board initiated close collaborations with regulators from national, European and international regulatory authorities, including BfR and RIVM, ECHA, EFSA and EMA, and NIEHS, respectively. This cooperation resulted in an improved mutual understanding of the requirements and pitfalls of RAx approaches supported by NAMs, from a scientific, academic, and regulatory perspective. The project's Regulatory Advisory Board (representing the main agencies/ authorities) was set up in the course of the study as one of the first reactions to stakeholder feedback. It has since been key for the establishment of a reporting template for RAx cases. The extensive documentation and pre-validation of the EU-ToxRisk NAM toolbox is a step forward to increase the acceptability of regulatory dossiers based on NAM data.

Irrespective, there was valuable feedback from regulatory specialists on the relative importance of high-end science vs the more basic quality control and documentation aspects. An important notion was that it is critical for regulators to quickly understand a new method; its information value, its purpose and its quality status. Similar considerations applied to data generated via NAMs, and it was enlightening to many contributing partners that the level of information sufficing for publication did not scale with regulatory requirements. The project team responded to this essential notion from the Regulatory Advisory Board by ensuring that all NAMs are described in a maximally transparent way to enable regulatory toxicologists to assess quality, reliability, applicability, and relevance of method outputs (Pamies et al. 2020; Bal-Price et al. 2018; Krebs et al. 2019) . This approach was addressed by the use of comprehensive test method descriptions that also allow for the assessment of readiness levels of individual tools, combined with an efficient procedure for data upload (Krebs et al. 2020b ). An efficient data management system was developed as a hub to transparently enable connecting methods to data, integrating data derived from different methods, and linking the integrated data to confirm or reject an overall testing hypothesis (like RAx).",

            "text": "1. Method shop The width of in vitro and in silico NAMsand of strategies using them-is very large compared to traditional animal models. New concepts and business models are required to make broad panels of new models available to all stakeholders. 2. Human anchoring Method validation has traditionally relied on the correlation of NAM data with animal study data. Even though animal data was useful for the development of NAMs, they also have shortcomings towards chronic/long-term human health consequences. Therefore, the development and calibration of NAMs should also be anchored to human (patho)biology and not be calibrated exclusively by animal data. 3. Metabolism and transport More quantitative methods are required to predict the influence of metabolism and transport on the hazard of novel compounds. 4. Ab initio assessment Strategies need to be worked out to quickly arrive at a mechanistic hypothesis for the potential hazard of compounds with little or no prior safety information. 5. Non-toxicants A comprehensive strategy needs to be established on how to define compounds of low or no toxicity. This also requires measures for uncertainty. In particular, the risk of false-negative assessment needs to be evaluated. 6. Immune system Both native and adaptive immune responses can be involved in toxicity (Benedetti et al. 2013; Fasbender et al. 2020; Fredriksson et al. 2011 Fredriksson et al. , 2014 Leist et al. 1997; Monshi et al. 2013) . This notion needs further exploration to predict idiosyncratic reac-tions and chronic health consequences for more susceptible individuals. 7. Protection perspective Various past efforts attempted to substitute traditional hazard assessment with modern NAMs, following the concept that defined adverse Fig. 3 The EU-ToxRisk knowledge-sharing infrastructure. Data and metadata follow different flows to be processed and deposited into the respective data infrastructure. Raw data are processed and summarized before being deposited into the Biostudies database at EMBL-EBI. Metadata are generated for each data set and deposited together into the knowledge-sharing database run by Edelweiss Connect. The coupled information is used for statistical model building and can be explored via visualization tools. The collection of information allows for weightof-evidence-based decisionmaking processes Fig. 4 Elements of next-generation risk assessment (NGRA) framework. NGRA should see the shift from mainly using NAMs for filling demarcated data gaps to a human-centric overall protection concept underpinned by NAM-based hazard quantification. Immune responses need to be taken into account to predict idiosyncratic reactions and chronic health consequences. To quantify risk and while accounting for associated uncertainties, NGRA will rely on integra-tive systems toxicology-based modelling approaches, anchoring safety testing to in vivo human biology. Considering metabolism and transport early on will be key to arrive at hazard scenarios for new chemical compounds. To cater for the wider field of applied toxicology, NGRA should be developed with both toxic and non-toxic, and both data-rich and data-poor compounds in mind events need to be identified and the subsequent animalbased method to be substituted one-on-one by NAM(s). This strategy will fail for complex endpoints. It is even doubtful whether such an approach can cover all potential target organs and tissues in the human body, be it practically or at an acceptable cost. A future safety science concept may require a more revolutionary approach that is not anchored to traditional adverse outcomes, but rather to the identification of safe concentrations. Staying below such concentrations would protect the population from toxic effects by ensuring that no biological events linked to toxicity are activated. While some CSs of EU-ToxRisk started exploring this concept, future projects need to address this systematically. 8. Systems toxicology Points 3-6 need to be successfully incorporated into a comprehensive systems toxicology model, which will then eventually form the basis for point 9. This will involve outputs not only on concentration thresholds associated with hazard (and extrapolations to respective doses/exposures), but also quantify the associated uncertainties. 9. Next-generation risk assessment Similar to the work of EU-ToxRisk on hazard assessment, the next step is to progress towards NGRA, using NAM-based hazard quantification in combination with defined exposure scenarios and exposure models.",

Already some CSs in partnership with external industry stakeholders were initiated. Such joint CSs help to (1) inform strategic decisions, (2) prioritize chemicals within a group, and (3) support the problem-solving process in investigative toxicology (Beilmann et al. 2019) . Furthermore, the sustainability of the approaches will be supported by a commercialization platform that consolidates NAMs and NAM data from different partner organizations, and use the integrated results in both safety assessment and investigative toxicology. In this context, activities aiming to increase the international acceptance of the NAMs are crucial. This requires continued interactions amongst all relevant stakeholders groups, including industry, regulatory agencies, academia, policy-makers, and NGOs (Busquet et al. 2020) . For this reason, EU-ToxRisk provided many discussion platforms in the form of stakeholder meetings, conference sessions, and closed workshops with regulators and parallel projects. Recent examples of such activities are the workshops on microphysiological systems and their regulatory application (Marx et al. 2020) and on international acceptance of read-across approaches (Rovida et al. 2020a , b) (Box 5).",
