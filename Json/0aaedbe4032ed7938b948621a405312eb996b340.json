This has been the most important and necessary modification of our professional activities in the last few decades (1, 2) . Suddenly, much of what we used to do as teachers has had to be interrupted and/or modified, and we have had to exercise flexibility and creativity, adapting medical education to virtual environments. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound effect on medical education, and these times may forever change how future physicians are educated. In Brazil, as in many other countries, first-year medical students have to stay at home and all teaching and learning strategies have had to be changed to distance learning.",

Although we have all experienced losses of freedom and security concerning our health and the future, we noticed differences in both the time people take to adapt as well as in their responses to the challenge of change in their roles as medical educators during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

At the beginning of the second month of social isolation, with the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases and the fact that the return to medical school would take many months, we observed some teachers and students with behaviors consistent with bargaining. They started to negotiate what they could do after the end of the isolation period, in terms of classes, other activities, and assessments. Some medical students started to negotiate whether their voluntary activities could be considered equivalent to some clerkships to avoid delays in finishing medical school.",

Now, we observe that many people have begun to realize that there are gains and not only losses in this period, and acceptance has become more common. Many faculty and students have started to talk about the positive aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic: volunteering, mentoring, service to community, altruism, building professional identity, defining what is really important in the objectives and content of the medical program, and inter-professional education.",
