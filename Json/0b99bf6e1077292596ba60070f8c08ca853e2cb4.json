However, the cellular factors that control IFITM3 homeostasis and antiviral activity have not been fully elucidated. Using sitespecific photo-crosslinking and quantitative proteomic analysis, here we present the identification and functional characterization of VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase as a primary interaction partner of IFITM3. We show that IFITM3 ubiquitination at lysine 24 is crucial for VCP binding, trafficking, turnover, and engagement with incoming virus particles. Consistently, pharmacological inhibition of VCP/p97 ATPase activity leads to defective IFITM3 lysosomal sorting, turnover, and co-trafficking with virus particles. Our results showcase the utility of site-specific protein photo-crosslinking in mammalian cells and reveal VCP/p97 as a key cellular factor involved in IFITM3 trafficking and homeostasis. ., et al.

Among these ISGs, the IFN-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) family has been shown to be responsible for a significant portion of the IFN-mediated antiviral activity (Brass et al., 2009; Bailey et al., 2014) . In recent years, extensive studies have shown that IFITM3, the most active isoform of IFITM family (Brass et al., 2009; Gorman et al., 2016) , provides potent antiviral activity in mammalian cells against many pathogenic viruses, including influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, human immunodeficiency virus, SARS coronavirus, and Ebola virus (Brass et al., 2009; Weidner et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2011; Lu et al., 2011; Perreira et al., 2013; Bailey et al., 2014) . In line with cellular studies, Ifitm3 homozygous knockout mice are more susceptible to influenza virus infection (Bailey et al., 2012; Everitt et al., 2012) . More importantly, a significant percentage of human patients hospitalized by seasonal influenza virus infection carries a genetic polymorphism expressing partial loss-of-function alleles of IFITM3 (Zhang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Zani and Yount, 2018) . Therefore, IFITM3 appears to be a key IFNinduced host effector restricting viral infection in mammals.",

            "text": "Over the years, many studies have explored the biochemical properties and antiviral mechanism of IFITM3. IFITM3 is largely localized to intracellular late endolysosomes (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., Desai et al., 2014; Weston et al., 2014) , and may traffic from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments via an N-terminal YxxF sorting motif (Jia et al., 2012 (Jia et al., , 2014 Chesarino et al., 2014a) . IFITM3 is further regulated by post-translational modifications in mammalian cells (Chesarino et al., 2014b) . We previously discovered that S-palmitoylation at conserved membrane-proximal cysteine residues regulates IFITM3 membrane targeting and antiviral activity (Yount et al., 2010; Percher et al., 2016) , and that ubiquitination of lysine residues controls its turnover and stability (Yount et al., 2012) . IFITM3 does not block the binding or uptake of viruses into host cells, but instead restricts deposition of viral contents into cytosol (Feeley et al., 2011) by preventing virus-cell fusion (Liao et al., 2019) . Studies have initially suggested that IFITM3 blocks viral membrane hemifusion (Li et al., 2013b) , but then implied that IFITM3 inhibits fusion pore formation at a post-hemifusion stage (Desai et al., 2014; Suddala et al., 2019) through directly changing membrane fluidity and/or curvature (Lin et al., 2013; Chesarino et al., 2017) or by indirectly altering the lipid concentration and/or composition of vesicle membranes (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) . In addition, IFITM3 was shown to incorporate into nascent virions during viral assembly to limit viral entry (Compton et al., 2014; Tartour et al., 2014) . Furthermore, IFITM3 may directly suppress viral protein synthesis to restrict virus replication (Lee et al., 2018) . Nevertheless, there is still no clear consensus on the precise antiviral mechanism of IFITM3 (Diamond and Farzan, 2012; Liao et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "To further characterize the biochemical and cellular properties of IFITM3, we sought to identify its interacting proteins by mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Profiling of IFITM3-interacting proteins has been challenging with standard co-immunoprecipitation (coIP)-MS approach. Indeed, due to the ''stickiness'' of IFITM3 as a membrane protein, such analyses previously conducted by us and others mainly recovered IFITM3 homo-or hetero-oligomerizations (John et al., 2013) as well as many ''false-positive'' membrane-associated proteins (Fu et al., 2017; Hubel et al., 2019) . Moreover, membrane protein interactions may only be retained under a native lipid environment, which is often disrupted by detergents during cell lysis (Daley, 2008) . To overcome this technical issue, we turned our attention to in-cell photo-crosslinking, which generates a covalent bond between interacting proteins upon photoirradiation (Tanaka et al., 2008; Pham et al., 2013; Peng and Hang, 2015) . As a result of the covalent complex formation, stringent or even denaturing conditions for cell lysis and protein isolation can be utilized to eliminate non-specific false-positives. More importantly, photo-crosslinking in live cells allows trap of protein interactions under native conditions. In this regard, photo-crosslinkable UAAs have been site-specifically incorporated into proteins of interest via amber suppression technology (Chin et al., 2002; Hino et al., 2005; Tippmann et al., 2007; Ai et al., 2011; Chou et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2017) , which enabled covalent capture of protein-protein interactions in live cells and identification by MS analysis Yang et al., 2016; He et al., 2017; Kleiner et al., 2018) .",

We show that VCP, in complex with the UBXD1 cofactor, mainly associates with ubiquitinated IFITM3. The ubiquitination-deficient lysine 24 mutant of IFITM3 exhibits delayed turnover, impaired steady-state distribution in lysosomes, and altered co-trafficking with incoming virus particles. In line with these results, depletion of the VCP-UBXD1 complex leads to abnormal turnover and accumulation of IFITM3. Moreover, we demonstrate that chemical inhibition of VCP ATPase activity results in accumulation of ubiquitinated IFITM3, delayed The amber suppression technology mediates site-specific incorporation of the diazirine-containing DiZPK into IFITM3, which enables in-cell photo-crosslinking with interacting proteins.

We selected several amino acid positions on IFITM3 that are situated in different domains of the protein (Figure 2A ). These residues are not essential for IFITM3 activity (John et al., 2013) , free of post-translational modifications, and likely accessible for protein-protein interactions. We then mutated them individually into the amber codon TAG for DiZPK incorporation. To evaluate the amber suppression efficiency in mammalian cells, HEK293T cells were co-transfected with two plasmids encoding an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pair and an HA-tagged IFITM3-TAG mutant, i.e., pCMV-DiZPK-PylRS and pCMV-HA-IFITM3-TAG, respectively, in the absence or presence of DiZPK. Western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates indicated that all IFITM3-TAG mutants afforded full-length protein expressions with varying levels that were dependent on the presence of DiZPK ( Figure 2B ). Notably, IFITM3-TAG mutants with the amber codon positions near the C terminus also generated a large portion of truncated proteins, suggesting suboptimal amber suppression efficiency at these near C-terminal positions. It is possible that truncated proteins were also generated for other IFITM3 mutants, but degraded more efficiently than longer truncated proteins observed for C-terminal IFITM3 mutants.",

As expected, a series of slower-migrating bands indicative of higher-molecular-weight photo-crosslinked complexes were observed for all IFITM3-TAG mutants only when cells were treated with UV irradiation ( Figure 2C ). Interestingly, IFITM3 mutants with varying DiZPK positions showed distinct photo-crosslinking patterns and efficiency ( Figure 2C ), suggesting that IFITM3 photo-crosslinking induced by DiZPK is largely dependent on the location and environment of the UAA. Moreover, the photo-crosslinked complexes can be efficiently isolated by anti-HA IP ( Figure S1A ).

In this regard, we cultured HEK293T cells with SILAC media before transfection to express DiZPK-modified HA-IFITM3 and then treated the cells with UV irradiation, which was grouped as the ''photo-crosslinking sample''; as the ''non-photo-crosslinking control,'' cells cultured in corresponding SILAC medium were not treated with UV. After cell lysis, the photo-crosslinking sample and non-photo-crosslinking control were equally mixed, subjected to anti-HA affinity purification, and analyzed by MS for protein identification and quantification ( Figure 3A ). It is worth mentioning that we used very harsh denaturing conditions (i.e., 4% SDS) for cell lysis to break non-covalent IFITM3 interactions and favor identification of covalent complexes. Moreover, to eliminate potential false-positives and increase identification reliability, we performed two sets of proteomics experiments by switching the SILAC labels and UV treatment conditions (termed ''forward'' and ''reverse'' SILAC experiments); i.e., in the forward SILAC experiment, only heavy-labeled cells were UV irradiated ( Figure 3A ), whereas only light-labeled cells were UV irradiated in the reverse SILAC experiment. We initially focused on IFITM3 modified with DiZPK at position 8 for photo-crosslinking proteomics studies, as this mutant exhibited optimal photo-crosslinking efficiency. The forward and reverse SILAC experiments robustly recovered one protein, i.e., VCP (valosincontaining protein, also called p97), that was selectively more enriched in the photo-crosslinking sample versus the non-photo-crosslinking control ( Figure 3B ; Table S1), thus indicating that VCP is crosslinked to IFITM3 in response to UV. Notably, the proteomics analysis also identified many other proteins ( Figure 3B , shown in black) that were not enriched in photo-crosslinking samples, including IFITM3-interacting proteins, such as VAPA (Table S1 ) (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) , and non-specific binders, such as ribosomal proteins.",

As shown in Figure 3C , VCP indeed interacts with IFITM3 as revealed by the co-immunoprecipitated VCP bands. More importantly, a slower-migrating band with molecular weight equal to the summed mass of VCP and IFITM3 was observed only for DiZPK-modified IFITM3 in the presence of UV, confirming the formation of photocrosslinked IFITM3-VCP complex ( Figure 3C ). We also performed a similar photo-crosslinking experiment on other IFITM3-TAG mutants. Intriguingly, IFITM3-TAG mutants with DiZPK incorporated at the N terminus (e.g., positions 8, 29, and 45) showed relatively stronger photo-crosslinked bands with VCP, whereas DiZPK at position 93 and 122 almost failed to induce crosslinking ( Figure S1B ), again confirming that the photo-crosslinking efficiency is dependent on DiZPK position.

VCP is a hexameric AAA-type ATPase involved in diverse cellular processes, ranging from endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) to membrane fusion, nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activation, and chromatin-associated degradation (Meyer et al., 2012; Stach and Freemont, 2017; Ye et al., 2017) . Additional coIP experiments with FLAG-tagged VCP further confirmed that both exogenously introduced and endogenously expressed IFITM3 associated with VCP ( Figures  4A and 4B ). We observed that ubiquitinated IFITM3 co-immunoprecipitated with VCP ( Figure 4A ), consistent with the common feature of VCP-involved processes that all require ubiquitinated substrates (Stach and Freemont, 2017) . To determine whether ubiquitination of IFITM3 is essential for interaction with VCP, we analyzed IFITM3 single-lysine mutants and a quadruplelysine mutant, in which all four lysines were mutated to alanine (i.e., K*A). Our results showed that K24 was the major ubiquitination site, and that K24A and K*A mutants of IFITM3 were both nearly non-ubiquitinated ( Figure 4C ), consistent with our previous studies on mouse Ifitm3 (Yount et al., 2012) . Moreover, coIP revealed that binding of IFITM3 K24A or K*A mutant to VCP was indeed greatly diminished ( Figure 4D ), implying that IFITM3 ubiquitination at N-terminal K24 is essential for interacting with VCP. Because VCP requires different cofactors to fulfill distinct roles (Stach and Freemont, 2017) , we probed the anti-HA immunoprecipitates with specific antibodies against well-known VCP cofactors, such as p47 (also known as NSFL1C) and UBXD1 (also known as UBXN6). These experiments showed that the interaction complex of IFITM3 and VCP involved UBXD1 as the cofactor ( Figure 4D ). Taken together, these data suggest that IFITM3 interacts with VCP largely in a ubiquitination-dependent manner, with UBXD1 as the cofactor.",

As both ubiquitination and VCP interaction are implicated in protein degradation, we first monitored the degradation of IFITM3-K24A mutant in parallel with wild-type. Cells expressing HA-IFITM3 were treated with cycloheximide (CHX) for different time periods and analyzed by western blot. We observed that the ubiquitination-deficient K24A variant was degraded much more slowly compared with wild-type IFITM3 (Figures 5A and 5B), indicating that K24 ubiquitination is an important regulator of IFITM3 turnover and stability.",

Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that the K24A mutant exhibited more diffuse intracellular signals compared with wildtype IFITM3 ( Figure 5C ). Although wild-type IFITM3 colocalized (legend continued on next page) frequently with lysosome marker protein LAMP1 as reported previously (Desai et al., 2014; Peng and Hang, 2016) , overlapping of the K24A mutant and LAMP1 was significantly reduced ( Figures  5C and 5D) , accounting for the impaired turnover of K24A mutant. In addition to steady-state distribution, we applied a previously developed live-cell fluorescence imaging method (Peng and Hang, 2016) to study the dynamic trafficking of K24A mutant during influenza A virus (IAV) infection. The method involves site-specific incorporation of a cycloalkene UAA into IFITM3 and subsequent bioorthogonal labeling with BODIPYtetrazine in live cells. We performed the live-cell imaging in HeLa IFITM2/3-KO cells that were infected with 1,1 0 -dioctactadecyl-3,3,3 0 ,3 0 -tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD)-labeled IAV particles . Disruption of ubiquitination by K24 mutation did not significantly affect virus-trafficking dynamics or total percentage of DiD-labeled virus particles that underwent lipid mixing ( Figure S2 ). However, we observed an apparent reduction in the percentage of virus particles colocalized with IFITM3-K24A or K24R mutant at the time of lipid mixing compared with wild-type IFITM3 (Figures 5E and S2G) , indicating that K24 ubiquitination is required for maximal incorporation of IFITM3 into virus-containing vesicles at the time of viral fusion. We also assessed the antiviral activity of IFITM3-K24A mutant against IAV infection. Interestingly, although the K24A mutant was still protective against IAV, its activity was slightly decreased compared with wild-type IFITM3 ( Figure 5F ). Together, these results demonstrate that site-specific K24 ubiquitination not only determines IFITM3 turnover and steady-state distribution in lysosomes but also regulates IFITM3 dynamic trafficking to incoming virus particles.",

As UBXD1 was shown to be specifically involved in the VCP-IFITM3 interaction complex ( Figure 4D ), we also included UBXD1 siRNA in these studies. Western blot analysis of whole-cell lysates confirmed specific and efficient interference of VCP or UBXD1 expression after treatment with respective siRNA ( Figure 6A ). We then monitored IFITM3 levels, ubiquitination status, and turnover rate after cellular depletion of VCP or UBXD1. As shown in Figures 6A and 6B , the endogenous levels of non-ubiquitinated IFITM3 in HeLa cells were upregulated by knockdown of VCP or UBXD1. Also, the IFITM3 ubiquitination levels were significantly increased in VCP-or UBXD1-depleted samples ( Figure 6A ). In line with these results, we repeatedly observed decreased ubiquitination levels of IFITM3, as well as downregulation of unmodified IFITM3, when VCP was overexpressed ( Figures 4A and S3) , suggesting that VCP facilitates the recycling of IFITM3. More importantly, consistent with the above results, the turnover rate of endogenous IFITM3 was greatly reduced when VCP or UBXD1 was knocked down (Figures 6C and 6D) . These results demonstrate that knockdown of VCP-UBXD1 complex impairs IFITM3 turnover and leads to accumulation in lysosomes, consistent with our K24A mutant data.",

Western blot analysis of exogenous IFITM3 demonstrated accumulation of both non-ubiquitinated and ubiquitinated IFITM3 after long-term treatment of cells with ML240 ( Figures  7A, S4A, and S4B ).

Treatment with lysosomal acidification inhibitors, such as chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 led to obvious accumulation of both ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated IFITM3 ( Figure S5A ), as observed in ML240 treatment. In contrast, proteasome inhibition with MG132 had almost no effect on IFITM3 and its ubiquitination levels, although MG132 did cause a general increase in cellular ubiquitination (Figure S5A ). In addition, similar to ML240, bafilomycin A1 was also shown to slow down the turnover of IFITM3 ( Figure S5B ). Meanwhile, our immunofluorescence studies confirmed that IFITM3 accumulated in LAMP1-positive lysosomal compartments upon treatment with bafilomycin A1 or ML240 ( Figure 7D ). More strikingly, both bafilomycin A1 and ML240 treatment led to significant enlargement of IFITM3-containing vesicles. The magnified images demonstrate that IFITM3 was restricted to the limiting membrane of these vesicles, pointing to a defect in sorting of IFITM3 into lysosomes for degradation ( Figure 7D ). These results suggest that IFITM3 is turned over via the lysosome degradation pathway, which relies on VCP ATPase activity for sorting into lysosomes.",

            "text": "Over the past decade, numerous research efforts have been made to characterize the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of IFITM3. As our continued endeavors in studying IFITM3 biochemical and antiviral properties, we integrated the amber suppression-enabled photo-crosslinking strategy with quantitative SILAC proteomics to identify IFITM3-interacting proteins. The unique advantage of photo-crosslinking to covalently stabilize protein interactions has indeed allowed reliable identification of VCP/p97 as an interaction partner of IFITM3. Notably, during preparation of this manuscript, a coIP-MS analysis on IFITM3 has been reported to identify over 70 IFITM3-interacting candidate proteins, including VCP as one of the confident hits (Hubel et al., 2019) . However, the IFITM3-VCP interaction and its functional significance were not validated. It is noteworthy that VAPA as a known IFITM3-interacting protein (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) was also identified in our proteomics analysis, but not enriched in the photo-crosslinking samples. This is reasonable as VAPA specifically interacts with IFITM3 transmembrane II domain (Amini-Bavil-Olyaee et al., 2013) , which is far away from the photo-activatable UAA. Other known IFITM3 interactors, such as tyrosine kinase FYN (Jia et al., 2012) and E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (Chesarino et al., 2015) , were not identified in our proteomics analysis, probably due to low cellular abundance. Consistently, these interacting proteins were also absent from the aforementioned coIP-MS study on IFITM3 (Hubel et al., 2019) . As demonstrated, the photo-crosslinking efficiency was highly dependent on DiZPK position, another unique feature of photo-crosslinking that only occurs between proteins in close proximity due to the short half-life of photogenerated reactive species. Therefore, photo-crosslinking proteomics on other positions should generate distinct IFITM3interacting proteins.",

Previous studies have shown that IFITM3 is ubiquitinated by NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is recruited via the PPxY motif (17-PPNY-20 in IFITM3) (Chesarino et al., 2015) . The lysine residue closest to the PPxY motif, K24 at the N terminus of IFITM3, was indeed confirmed to be exclusively (legend continued on next page) ubiquitinated. It was previously discovered that ubiquitination controls the turnover and stability of IFITM3 (Yount et al., 2012) . However, the exact regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Our present data provide evidence that, as a functional consequence of binding with ubiquitinated IFITM3, the VCP-UBXD1 complex regulates the trafficking and sorting of IFITM3 to lysosomes for turnover. This notion is supported by the observations that (1) mutation of K24 to Ala prevents interaction with the VCP-UBXD1 complex and, more importantly, interferes with IFITM3 transport to lysosomes for degradation ( Figure 5) ;",

            "text": "Dissection of the IFITM3 degradation pathway provides important insights into the intrinsic regulatory mechanism for IFITM3. IFITM3 is expressed at a low basal level in most cell types but becomes highly expressed upon IFN stimulation. Besides inhibiting virus infection, IFITM3 has recently been shown to be involved in other biological processes, for example, shuttling IFN regulatory factor 3, a critical transcription factor for activating IFN production, to lysosomes for degradation (Jiang et al., 2018) , and blocking syncytin-mediated fusion to impair syncytiotrophoblast formation (Buchrieser et al., 2019; Zani et al., 2019) , which are surprisingly deleterious to immune defense and fetal development, respectively. Moreover, IFITM3 is highly expressed in many cancers and has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis (Schoenherr et al., 2017; Min et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2019) . These findings suggest that temporal control of IFITM3 expression levels is crucial for its physiological functions. Our study thus highlights the importance of the VCP-UBXD1 complex in modulating the expression levels and biological consequences of IFITM3. It is, however, still worth mentioning that other pathways are not excluded for IFITM3 degradation, especially under stress conditions. For example, it was recently shown that rapamycin-induced degradation of IFITM3 partially requires the ESCRT machinery (Shi et al., 2018) .",

As IFITM3 oligomerization is believed to directly affect membrane fluidity and curvature (John et al., 2013) , disassembly of IFITM3 oligomers is likely to be required for transport of IFITM3 from limiting membrane to intraluminal vesicles. Notably, VCP, as well as its homolog Cdc48, has emerged as a universal segregase protein that binds to ubiquitinated proteins and uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to extract them from lipid membranes or macromolecular complexes (Cooney et al., 2019; Twomey et al., 2019) .

We observed that the interaction-less K24A mutant was less efficient to restrict IAV infection compared with wildtype IFITM3 ( Figure 5F ). It was noted that most of the antiviral activity of IFITM3-K24A mutant was still retained. This may be explained by the residual interaction of K24A mutant with VCP ( Figure 4D ) and/or enhanced stability of this mutant ( Figures 5A and 5B ) at steady state contributing to virus restriction (Yount et al., 2012) . As long-term treatment of cells with VCP inhibitor ML240 (e.g., 12-24 h) leads to increased steady-state IFITM3 levels, we applied acute ML240 treatment (i.e., 4 h) of virus-infected cells to differentiate its short-term effects on IFITM3 antiviral activity from the prolonged effects on IFITM3 levels. Interestingly, our pharmacological study showed that acute treatment with ML240 antagonized the antiviral capability of IFITM3 ( Figure 7F ), implying that VCP may be required for its complete antiviral activity. It is important to note that ML240 appeared to be quite specific to VCP, showing little activity against protein kinases and receptors (Chou et al., 2013) . Only limited kinases, such as PIP5K3 and DNAPK (Chou et al., 2013) were shown to be slightly inhibited by ML240. As they have not been implicated in IFITM3 function and host immunity against viruses from previous genome-wide screenings (Shah et al., 2015; Puschnik et al., 2017) , these potential off-targets of ML240 do not likely affect interpretation of our results. Nevertheless, it is still possible that unknown ML240 offtarget effects (Bastola and Chien, 2018) would contribute to the phenotypes on IFITM3 we observed. Unfortunately, the multiple functions and targets of VCP, as well as its cofactor UBXD1, have precluded us from using siRNA interference in (D) Immunofluorescence analysis of HA-IFITM3 in the presence of bafilomycin A1 or ML240.

Similar photo-crosslinking proteomic analyses on other IFITM3-TAG mutants in future should enable profiling of the complete IFITM3 interactome. In addition, the site-specific protein photo-crosslinking approach described here should broadly facilitate functional analysis of other host effectors involved in immune response.",

Characterization of the antiviral properties and regulatory mechanisms of IFITM3 is critical for advancing our understanding of innate immune response as well as host-pathogen interactions. Facing this biological question, we apply a chemical biology approach that integrates site-specific protein modification via amber suppression with photo-crosslinking and SILAC quantitative proteomics to profile the interacting proteins of IFITM3 in live cells. Retrieved as the top hit from the proteomic analysis, the VCP/p97 AAA-ATPase is validated to interact with IFITM3 and functionally characterized to be a regulator for IFITM3 lysosomal distribution, turnover, and trafficking to incoming virus particles. Our study, therefore, not only demonstrates the utility of this integrative site-specific photo-crosslinking proteomics strategy to profile protein interactions in live cells, but also provides important insights into the regulatory mechanisms of IFITM3 as a critical host immune factor.",
