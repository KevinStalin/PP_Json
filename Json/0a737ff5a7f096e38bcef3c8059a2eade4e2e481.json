People who cross the Polish border or have had contact with contagious persons are obligated to be quarantined for 14 days.

Moreover, Pedrozo-Pupo et al. studied the impact of the pandemic on stress and noted that 15% of participants have higher stress levels due to COVID\u221219 pandemic.

The majority of women had higher (74.2%) or secondary (24.5%) education and lived in cities above 500,000 residents (33.1%). Most of the respondents were in informal relationships (68%), 24.8% were married, and only 7.2% of them were declared single. Almost three quarters of women have never been pregnant before (72,4%). The most common religion was Catholicism (63.5%). Table 1 presents general characteristics of the studied group (Table 1) Overall FSFI score before the pandemic was 30.1 \u00b1 4.4 and changed to 25.8 \u00b1 9.7 during it. In addition, scores of every domain: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain decreased as well (p < 0.001). Desire decreased from 4.5 \u00b1 1.0 to 4.2 \u00b1 1.3, arousal 5.1 \u00b1 0.9 to 4.1 \u00b1 2.0, lubrication 5.4 \u00b1 0.8 to 4.5 \u00b1 2.1, orgasm 4.8 \u00b1 1.3 to 3.9 \u00b1 2.1, satisfaction 5.2 \u00b1 1.0 to 4.7 \u00b1 1.4 and pain 5.1 \u00b1 1.1 to 4.3 \u00b1 2.1. Table 2 shows the mean overall FSFI and several domains scores prior and during pandemic. The number of women with sexual dysfunction (overall FSFI score 26 or below) before the pandemic was 15.3% and increased to 34.3% during total lockdown; thus, association was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Moreover, during the pandemic, the frequency of sexual intercourse declined compared to the period before, and this association is demonstrated in Figure 1 . The majority of women declared that the reason might be associated with isolation from the partner (41.5%), 39.3% felt lack of desire caused by stress, and 16% chose misunderstandings with their partners as a cause.

In SARS and MERS, the most common causes of death were progressive respiratory failure and severe sepsis. Micelli et al. (2020) evaluated the impact of COVID\u221219 on the desire for parenthood in Italian people of reproductive age with stable relationships. More than one-third of couples, who were planning to have a child, decided to interrupt the pursuit at the time of the pandemic. Among reasons, researchers named mainly the fear of economic instability and lack of knowledge of pregnancy outcomes related to infection. Moreover, the changes in cardiorespiratory and immune systems occurring during the pregnancy might increase the susceptibility to serious infections. Interestingly, the study has also revealed that about 12% of people (mostly women) started to desire parenthood at the time of the quarantine [13, 16] .",

This may mean that in the group of non-working women, the causes of FSFI decrease are lack of activity and fatigue due to the everyday routine. A study conducted by Lee et al. somehow confirms our reports. They demonstrated that family income can affect sex life satisfaction; therefore, women who work on a normal basis are not only exposed to less stress but also have constant salary, which may lead to a more satisfying sex life compared to women who do not work at all. Likewise, the biggest decrease was reported among single women, a smaller one in those who are in a relationship and the smallest in marriages. Although normally relationship satisfaction plays the main role in sex life quality, we suggest that the lockdown limits the opportunities to meet new people and make new relationships [17, 18] .",

The smallest differences were noticed in the case of women who live only with their partner. However, living with parents seems to have an obvious impact on intimacy, and living alone reduces the ability of meeting people, an interesting fact is the bigger change in FSFI score in families with children compared to those who are childless. Stavdal et al. examined intimacy and sex life between parents after the first childbirth. They emphasized the fact that in many cases babies take all of the attention and eventually parents have less intimacy and time for each other. In our opinion, additionally anxiety about a child's health during pandemic plays the main role in deterioration of relations between the lovers [20] .",

In addition, it eventually affected the level of stress and anxiety. The attention of doctors is now mainly focused on infectious diseases and their symptoms, but in this unusual situation we must not forget that a pandemic affects many different aspects of human health, including sex life. Therefore, if we want to avoid long-term effects and improve quality of life, we should pay attention to sex satisfaction at every medical visit. Additionally, our study showed that certain relationships between partners deteriorated, and the levels of stress and anxiety increased; thus, the role of every doctor is getting this information in anamnesis and if applicable suggesting psychotherapy. Moreover, we should consider how to facilitate contact with sexologists in this difficult time of limited interpersonal contacts, for which telemedicine can help us a lot [21] .",
