The authors conducted their critical appraisal independently and discussed their assessments to reach consensus. We found that generally, few papers report the reasoning behind data collection and analytical methods used. Very few studies include indications of reflexivity. In spite of flaws in reporting, all studies provided valuable insights, and appeared to have been conducted appropriately. None of the studies that met the inclusion criteria were excluded based on poor quality. Instead, quality issues were considered when evaluating confidence in review findings using GRADE-CerQUAL. The exact methodology of CERQual is described in (12) .

The review further indicates that it is critical for policymakers and service providers to recognise the toll measures can take on people. The evidence from the review also shows that preventing stigma, appealing to solidarity, building trust, and making sure that strong support systems are put in place are important in order to alleviate hardship faced by the population that is expected to adhere to social distancing. Finally, effective, transparent, trustworthy communication appears to be a central enabler to the acceptability of and adherence to social distancing measures. Responsible communication should be transparent, timely, clear and uniform, and trusted experts should be at the forefront. Good communication acknowledges uncertainty and the need to adapt to changing circumstances. The evidence also suggests that messaging should be context-specific and relevant to people's lives. All of these recommendations are concrete and actionable opportunities for policymakers and service providers as well as anyone who communicates with the public.",

These and many other factors appear to influence acceptability of social distancing and people's adherence to measures that are necessary for the pandemic response. Policies should be designed with these factors in mind to ensure an effective, ethical and equitable pandemic response.
