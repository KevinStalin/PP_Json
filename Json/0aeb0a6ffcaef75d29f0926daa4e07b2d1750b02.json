This is associated to the progressive waning of immunity against the mumps component of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine in absence of a natural booster (especially from 10 years after administration of the second dose), the use in the 1993---1999 period of a vaccine that had the Rubini strain, which proved to be less effective, and the presence of pockets of unvaccinated people in the population. 1 In Spain, 10 260 cases were notified in 2017 and 8996 in 2018, a significant increase compared to previous seasons. 2 Some of the infectious agents other than MuV that may be involved in parotitis as a general clinical presentation include influenza A virus, parainfluenza virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus, coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), parvovirus B19, herpesvirus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, as well as gram-positive bacteria, atypical mycobacteria and Bartonella species. 3---5 In the paediatric population, these pathogens are probably more frequent causative agents compared to MuV. This, combined with the benign course of most presentations, leads many paediatric health care facilities to make the diagnosis without an aetiological investigation. The aim of our study was to establish the viruses involved in cases of parotitis in our area.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 519, "end": 520, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 637, "end": 638, "text": "2", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1032, "text": "3---5", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Caracterizaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica y etiol\u00f3gica de los casos de parotiditis en un servicio de urgencias"}, {"text": "We carried out a retrospective study through the collection of data corresponding to 2 full years (2016 and 2017), including all patients given a diagnosis of parotitis (with swelling of the parotid glands being a requirement for inclusion) in the paediatric emergency department of a tertiary \u0b1d Please cite this article as: Scatti-Reg\u00e0s A., Aguilar-Ferrer M.C., Ant\u00f3n-Pagarolas A., Mart\u00ednez-G\u00f3mez X., Gonz\u00e1lez-Peris S.

Per hospital protocol, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for detection of MuV in saliva and urine samples were performed in patients with parotitis. Serologic tests were added if blood tests were requested by the paediatrician in charge based on his or her clinical judgment. When it came to serologic testing, in case of negative results of the test for detection of MuV in saliva, molecular methods were used for detection of influenza A and B virus, respiratory syncytial virus A/B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus nl63/OC43/229E, enterovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, EBV and CMV.

Viral coinfection was also frequent. Lastly, we ought to underscore that MuV continues to be a frequent cause of parotitis in our area (especially in older children), even in correctly vaccinated patients, and our findings confirmed that the causative virus continues to circulate in the community with a well-known pattern characterised by incidence peaks every 3---5 years. The aetiological diagnosis and notification of cases can alert the health care authorities of potential outbreaks at an early stage, allowing implementation of containment measures such as administration of a third dose of vaccine in selected patients. 6 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 317, "end": 322, "text": "3---5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1280, "end": 1281, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Caracterizaci\u00f3n cl\u00ednica y etiol\u00f3gica de los casos de parotiditis en un servicio de urgencias"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Waning immunity against mumps in vaccinated young adults", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Vygen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Fischer", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Meurice", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Mounchetrou", "middle": [], "last": "Njoya", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Gregoris", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Ndiaye", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "B", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2013, "venue": "Euro Surveill", "volume": "21", "issn": "10", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Non-mumps Viral Parotitis During the 2014-2015 Influenza Season in the United States", "authors": [{"first": "L", "middle": ["I"], "last": "Elbadawi", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "P", "middle": [], "last": "Talley", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Rolfes", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Millman", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "E", "middle": [], "last": "Reisdorf", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Kramer", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2018, "venue": "Clin Infect Dis", "volume": "67", "issn": "4", "pages": "493--501", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Letter to the editor: there is a need to consider all respiratory viruses in suspected mumps cases", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Shepherd", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": ["R"], "last": "Maclean", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Aitken", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["N"], "last": "Gunson", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Euro Surveill", "volume": "20", "issn": "33", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Viral etiology of mumps-like illnesses in suspected mumps cases reported in Catalonia", "authors": [{"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Barrabeig", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Costa", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Rovira", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Marcos", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Isanta", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "L\u00f3pez-Adalid", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Spain.
