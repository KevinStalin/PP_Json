Then the reaction was brought to room temperature and stirred at same temperature for 12 hours. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and resulting residue was purified by column chromatography to give 15 contaminated with triphenylphosphine oxide (176 mg, 65%). To the crude 15 (176 mg, 0.45 mmol) was treated with LiOH (68 mg mg, 1.35 mmol) in THF-H2O (1:1) solution (8 mL) for 12 hours at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure and resulting residue was purified by column chromatography to give 16 contaminated with tripenylphosphine oxide (127 mg, 95%).",
