Most often, FFP respirators consist of multiple layers of non-woven fabric made from 8 polypropylene.

During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, health 10 authorities have temporarily repealed standards for respirators. 11",

Nasal symptoms are mostly 30 limited to dysfunctions in smell and taste. While most of the registered cases show a mild and 31 transient course of disease, in about 5% of patients admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) is 32 necessary due to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and e.g. coagulopathy, pulmonary 33 embolism and the involvement of other organs including kidney, heart, and the central nervous 34 system 3 . SARS-CoV-2 infections are most often transmitted by direct mucosal contact to droplet-35 borne viruses originating from the nose or mouth of an infected individual 4 . Such exposure of 36 droplets to the eyes, mouth or nose, or inhalation of sneezed or coughed virus-containing particles 37 from the air, as well as smear infection are regarded as being common transmission mechanisms. 38",

Filtering facepiece 42 particles (FFP) masks are among the most frequently used items of personal protective equipment 43 (PPE) in the medical field, and legislation and mandated protection measures in most public and 44 business areas have made them an inherent feature to everyday life in many countries. Their 45 purpose is to protect the wearer of the mask from particles, droplets and aerosols, but they can also 46 prevent the spread of aerosol-transmitted viruses if the wearer becomes infected. However, 47 depending on the design of the FFP, the latter only applies to masks without exhalation valve, 48 filtering both inhaled and exhaled air and therefore providing both self-protection and extrinsic 49 protection,. Models with exhalation valve do not filter the exhaled air. FFP respirators work by 50 filtering out particles thanks to the structure of their nonwoven material as they get trapped being 51 forced to make twists and turns through the dense network of the material's fibres, which may be as 52 thin as a single micron. In addition, masks may have electrostatically charged material to further 53 attract particles. With increasing amounts of particles within the nonwoven mask material, it even 54 becomes a more efficient filter. However, the build-up also makes the mask more difficult to breathe 55 through, which is why the masks and filters are made to be disposable. 56 57 Filtering facepiece mask regulations 58 specify required physical properties and performance characteristics in order for FFP masks to 60 comply with a certain protective standard. During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, health authorities often 61 referenced these standards when making recommendations for minimal protective standard in 62 different situations, depending on infection risk. A very commonly recommended standard for health 63 professionals is FFP2; however, nomenclature of standards differs throughout the world. Table 1  64 summarizes important international standards for respirator masks. It may be reasonable to 65 consider China KN95, AS/NZ P2, Korea 1st Class, and Japan DS2 FFRs as \"equivalent\" to US 66 NIOSH N95 and European FFP2 respirators, for filtering at least 94% of non-oil-based particles 67 such as virus bio-aerosols. Within these categories, masks are expected to function very 68 similarly to one another, and conformity testing to physical standard is required for certification. 69",

If symptoms can 127 be matched to a particular work environment, the pathology can be classified as 'work-exacerbated' reported to be associated 15 . The induction of nasal hyperreactivity (NHR) with one or more nasal 130 symptoms upon encounter of unspecific environmental stimuli such as smoke, 131 temperature/humidity changes, strong odors and physical or other irritants is a key clinical feature 15 The here-presented mask-associated IR is unusual with regards to the broad use of FFP masks even 142 before the pandemic. Reports on IR in healthcare workers and other mask-requiring professionals are 143 rare, even though time of wearing was likely similar to the currently observed long periods due to 144 COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, the deregulation of mask fabrication and material safety requirements, 145 resulting in the widespread distribution of non-CE marked products has to be discussed as a potential 146 hazard to user safety. Our hypothesis is that the fabric of certain non-CE masks are more likely to 147 seed parts of their fabric polypropylene into the inspiratory air flow, leading to accumulation on 148 nasal mucosa and potentially throughout the airways. Due to the lack of branding information on the 149 FFP masks used by the here-presented patients, a thorough investigation regarding CE certification 150 and fulfilment of claimed physical standards was not possible for us, which presents a limitation to 151 this study. In conclusion, with COVID-19 numbers decreasing in some countries and recovering of 152 medical supply stocks, user safety has to become an equal priority for regulation authorities again. 153",

The cellular and inflammatory mechanisms causing IR in our study subjects are 136 still under investigation; however, here-assessed parameters in nasal secretions emphasize a central 137 role of mast cell degranulation. Mast cells are thought to be attracted by foreign body reactions and 138 may attract macrophages through degranulation, maintaining and priming the inflammatory 139 response in previous animal models 16 . Further studies are needed to investigate these mechanisms 140 in patients with face mask-related IR. 141",
