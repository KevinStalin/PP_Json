Theoretically, RP means that SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's body may not been completely cleared or is experiencing reinfection.

Because of the need for epidemic prevention and control, all weakly and dubious positive RT-PCR results were regarded as positive. All diagnosed children were admitted to the designated hospital (the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen) for isolation and treatment, and relevant examinations were completed as routine procedures. Fever was recognized when body temperature is higher than or equal to 37.3\u2103. Respiratory symptoms included nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough, expectoration, chest pain, and dyspnea.

Also, they did not exhibit the onset of reinfection or RP during the follow-up period. Furthermore, recovered patients had to be isolated at home for 2 weeks after discharge and almost had no contact with the outside world. Therefore, the possibility that individuals exhibiting RP were reinfected by other patients is very low. RP is more likely to mean that the previously infected SARS-CoV-2 was not completely cleared, which has complicated decision-making around discontinuing isolation or home quarantine. 9 He et al. 12 observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset and inferred that infectivity peaked on or before symptom onset. These observations indicate that early droplet isolation and disinfection of the home environment may be the top priority for cutting off SARS-CoV-2 transmission in households and reducing RP. 13 The underlying viral clearance mechanism in children is still not completely understood. 14 CD4+ T lymphocytes are the center of the months. As far as we know, there is still no accurate answer to why the WBC in the RP group is higher than the control group. However, PCT, hs-CRP, and IL-6 are within the normal range and there is no difference between the two groups, suggesting that the impact of coinfection is negligible. We speculate that this may be related to the weak response of the innate immune system and the reduction of WBC depletion.",

CD8+ T lymphocytes mediate cellular immunity and play a vital role in the immune response to viral infections. Chu et al. 15 demonstrated that Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection can induce T lymphocytes apoptosis through the activation of external and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Coleman et al.16 found that the depletion of CD4+, CD8+ T lymphocytes, or macrophages had no effect on the replication of MERS-CoV in the infected lungs of mice. Earlier studies had demonstrated that SARS-CoV, which shares the same cell entry receptors with MERS-CoV, could infect immune cells including T lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes decreased at the onset of illness.17,18 These studies indicate that the reduction of T lymphocytes may contribute to the continuous replication of SARS-CoV-2 and RP. However, our investigation did not observe a similar change, and no significant differences were detected between the two groups at the first test after admission. This discrepancy may present for the following reasons: first, the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 may be weaker than other coronaviruses.19,20 The sampling time point may be in the early stage of COVID-19. Children's immune response is different from adults', relatively slower and weaker.20 This may also explain why children's COVID-19 is more asymptomatic or mild.3,5,9 Second, the sample size is small, and there are many missing values in the control group, which may be different from the true level. But interestingly, the dynamic changes of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the recovery period showed obvious differences between groups and time asynchrony. CD8+ T lymphocytes of the control group declined very early and reached the lowest point at 2 weeks, then gradually increased, while that of the RP group did not decline significantly over this interval. On the contrary, CD4+ T lymphocytes of the RP group declined slowly and reached the lowest point at 2 months, while that of the control group rose at this time. In summary, CD8+ T lymphocytes of the control group at 2 weeks and CD4+ T lymphocytes of the RP group at 2 months were most significantly depleted. Our data suggest that the first 2 months of the recovery of COVID-19 in children may be a critical period for SARS-CoV-2 clearance, and immunomodulatory targeting CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes may be a promising treatment. The average WBC count of pediatric patients in our investigation was generally within the normal reference range, consistent with related reports.21 But the WBC count was significantly higher in the RP group than the control group at the first test after admission. After hospital discharge, the WBC count of both groups continued to decline synchronously and reached their lowest point at 2",
