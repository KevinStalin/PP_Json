An analysis in china has shown that children younger than 10 years account for only 1% of COVID-19 cases (4), similar to the proportion for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics (5, 6, 7).

However, in children, especially infants, there are no specific reports of neurological complications. In this study, we report an eight-month-old boy with recurrent partial seizure and mild diarrhea and COVID19 PCR positive.",
