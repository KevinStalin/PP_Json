            "text": "The epicenter of the current COVID-19 pandemic was Wuhan, China, which was later classified by WHO as a global health emergency. 1 The number of COVID-19 cases within mainland China was surpassed by reported cases outside of China on February 26, 2019. Coincidentally, the first two cases of Covid-19 in Pakistan were reported on that very date. 2 Moreover, one of the two cases was diagnosed at our hospital. 3 Consequently, being the largest tertiary care hospital in the biggest metropolis of our country, the hospital went on an orange alert, which meant that all of our services and resources were directed toward providing emergent and urgent care. Likewise, in line with the hospital policy and according to the international guidelines, the dental clinic went on an \"emergency-servicesonly\" protocol. 4 During the 6 weeks which followed, the dental clinic at our hospital provided dental services to over 500 patients \u00a9 2020 Special Care Dentistry Association and Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and performed more than 100 aerosol and nonaerosol generating procedures. Thankfully, none of the dental healthcare providers (DHCPs) at our hospital suffered from a COVID-19 infection. 5 This was in contrast to the 20% infection rate of our surgery colleagues. 3 In this paper, we will discuss the measures that were taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among DHCPs and provide a neoteric workflow for the provision of safe dental care as dental services move toward normalcy. an invaluable resource that directed our actions. 6 Changes in our practices were made in concordance and comprehensive administrative and engineering controls were undertaken to maintain social distancing and optimizing emergency patient care. 7 During the 6 weeks, several procedures were performed and details of which are presented in Table 1 . We consulted an average of 13 patients in a day which meant that our patient volumes were down to almost 10% of our regular clinics; historically almost 130-150 patients visit our clinic of which almost 30% seek emergent or urgent care, therefore our emergency visits were decreased by 20%. This can be attributed to the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic that influenced the patient's dental care-seeking behavior and similar results have been noted in another study. 8 Dentoalveolar abscess, acute-pericoronitis, pulpal, and periapical infections were the most common reasons for patients to seek emergency dental care, which is in concordance to other dental literature. The peculiar finding in our patients was that we had 30 patients who visited our clinic as orthodontic emergencies. This unique finding is because almost 600 patients are registered for orthodontic treatment at our hospital. 8 The most common procedure performed at our clinic was dental extraction followed by endodontic treatment.",

We have 64 staff members, of which 54 were fit tested. Forty-nine of them passed the fit test (Model # 8210,3M, St. Paul, MN), meaning that more than 90% of staff passed the fit test, which is a very good pass rate. Data show a large variation in pass rates ranging from 10 to 80% . [10] [11] [12] Ten staff members were not fit tested as they had beards and are considered an automatic fail due to lack of seal.

Nonaerosol generating procedures, for example, orthodontic wire change, are carried out in the same visit using appropriate PPE, while aerosol-generating procedures are carried out under rubber dam isolation and PPE. 20, 21 If the clinician determines that an aerosol-generating procedure is required (e.g., surgical extraction and/or apical surgery) in which isolation with rubber dam is not possible, the patient is required to undergo a pool test. 22 Pool testing is not a new concept. It is carried out to conserve resources. The test strategy at our hospital involves taking samples for RT-PCR of eight patients who are asymptomatic and classified as low risk to run the sample together. If it turns out negative, all patients tested are classified as negative. However, if the result is positive, it means that at least one patient in that pool is positive so individual RT-PCR is done for those eight patients to determine the positive individuals. This step, along with appropriate PPE, adds another layer of safety for our clinicians before conducting an aerosol-generating procedure in which rubber dam placement is not feasible. 22, 23 If the patient tests positive for COVID-19, and the procedure can differ, the patient is asked to differ treatment until the RT-PCR turns out negative.
