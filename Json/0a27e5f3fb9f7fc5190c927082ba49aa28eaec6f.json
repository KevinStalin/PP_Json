This was justified by the wish to shorten the period of viral replication in an immunocompromised patient so that their anticancer treatment could be started or restored as soon as possible. Overall, the type of treatment for the viral infection was empirical, at the clinician's discretion, and largely based on the therapies recommended for adults, such as hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir. Interestingly, 16 patients had their chemotherapy suspended until they had 2 negative NP swabs, but 10 patients continued their chemotherapy as originally scheduled (8 with no changes at all, and 2 with minor modifications). These data suggest that chemotherapy can be continued in patients with mild or no symptoms of COVID-19 without any worsening of the infection. This aspect is a major cause of concern, however, and needs to be analyzed in larger cohorts of patients.",
