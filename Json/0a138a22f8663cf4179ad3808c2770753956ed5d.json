In Europe, the spread of COVID-19 has sometimes highlighted an atypical clinical presentation, characterized by the involvement of upper airways and, above all, by the onset of olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions. 5 There is sufficient evidence worldwide that this disease is much less severe in children than in adults. 4 Although very common in adults, olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions remain an open issue in children, probably due to the lack of valid methods to assess these disorders among the pediatric population. This article aims to provide a focus on the upper airway involvement in pediatric COVID-19.",

This confirms that its symptomatology is linked to direct viral damage on the olfactory bulb and/or taste receptors. The importance of making a correct diagnosis stems from the consideration that in a not negligible percentage of cases, above all COVID-19 paucisymptomatic subjects, anosmia, and ageusia can represent the only symptomatic manifestation of the disease. Based on experience gained in Italy, it is essential to inform specialists, such as otolaryngologists or even allergists, to pay close attention to these possible clinical manifestations of COVID-19. Such knowledge would bring advantages in limiting the viral spread by poorly symptomatic subjects and acquiring new information on the possible pathogenesis of this new virus. Hopkins et al. have recently published a study conducted on 2,428 COVID-19 patients and concluded that anosmia in 1 out of 6 patients was the only symptom of disease 7 . Also, in the multicentre study published by Lechien et al., composed of 417 patients with mild or moderate COVID-19 disease, olfactory dysfunction was present in 11.8% of total cases before other symptoms. Furthermore, among 18.2% of patients without nasal obstruction or rhinorrhea, 79.7% were anosmic or hypoosmic.",
