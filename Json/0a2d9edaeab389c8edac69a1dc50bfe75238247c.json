            "text": "Gambling disorder is associated with severe financial, social, and psychological consequences, but treatment-seeking rates have been described to be low. Apart from formal treatment, motivational interventions in nontreatment-seeking high-risk gamblers have been shown to be promising. However, little is known about the effectiveness and acceptability of such motivational interventions carried out by a gambling operator as part of the company's responsible gambling policies. Early experiences of such interventions are limited by the risk that gambling in individuals reached with the intervention may continue with a different gambling operator. The present study aims to evaluate effectiveness and user acceptability of a responsible gambling intervention continuously carried out by the Swedish state-owned gambling operator Svenska Spel Sport & Casino. This intervention for high-risk gamblers, identified either through substantial monetary losses or through a voluntary self-test by the gambler, includes a motivational telephone intervention aiming to encourage the gambler to set deposit limits, practice self-exclusion, or seek help. This protocol paper describes the two-tailed evaluation of this intervention: (1) A retrospective, register-based study of the effectiveness of the motivational intervention on gambling expenditures, deposit limits, and self-exclusions in comparison to control individuals not reached by the intervention, including all clients reached or attempted to be reached during September 2019-April 2020 (total n = 3626), as well as a one-to-one matched comparison of clients reached (n = 1404) and not reached; and (2) a prospective web survey study in individuals reached by the same ongoing telephone intervention practice from November 2020 (target n = 200), measuring clients' attitudes to the intervention, perceived effects of the intervention on gambling, and their self-reported gambling on all operators after the intervention.",

Also, it is known that problem gamblers' trajectories to seeking and receiving help may be diverse, and may include strategies other than seeking formal treatment [11, 12] . Based on this, there is reason to consider the gambling operator's contact with gamblers as a window of opportunity for screening for high-risk gambling and for providing motivational or supportive interventions aiming to facilitate such treatment-seeking and to reduce gambling-related harm prior to treatment-seeking. It is of great relevance to address and intervene in hazardous gambling habits in close temporal association to gambling behavior. Here, responsible gambling practices to be adapted by gambling operators may be a promising tool in order to reach problem gamblers with motivational messages or support, helping them to reduce or quit gambling, and/or to motivate to actual treatment-seeking or other interventions, such as enrollment in voluntary self-exclusion programs.",

Thus, there are very few research reports that have documented such harm-reducing efforts provided by a gambling operator and that have considered the fact that such initiatives intuitively aim to decrease or discontinue the client's gambling. Such initiatives require either a legal requirement or a voluntary responsible gambling strategy from the gambling operator. Also, such interventions by gambling operators have been called for [13] . Furthermore, given the relatively limited active uptake of self-limiting interventions by gamblers themselves [14] , active responsible gambling contacts from the operator's part may be of intuitive importance. Given the potential role conflict in gambling operators addressing clients with the aim to make clients reduce their gambling involvement, such interventions have been understudied, although governmental-owned operators may present a window of opportunity for this kind of interventions [15] . Thus, much remains to be understood about how such operator-initiated harm reduction strategies are perceived by gamblers and how effective they are, and studies addressing these issues are therefore a relatively novel part of problem gambling research.",

            "text": "In Sweden, the state-owned gambling operator, AB Svenska Spel (corresponding to 'Svenska Spel Ltd.' in English language), established a responsible gambling intervention in 2018, aiming to contact gamblers demonstrating high-risk gambling behaviors in order to help motivate, reduce, or discontinue their gambling habits. Such advice may include, for example, the advice to practice self-exclusion from gambling from the operator's own system or in the overall national self-exclusion service, or advice to apply voluntary deposit limits and time limits within the operator's gambling sites. This intervention project was originally referred to as 'proactive calls' [16] and has been inspired by a long-standing tradition within the company of conducting motivational talks to land-based casino visitors who visit frequently. The telephone intervention studied here can be referred to as a motivational intervention by telephone, reaching high-risk gamblers who are either identified by the operator's own gambling history for the specific gamblers (high losses), or by the gambler taking a self-test (the GamTest [17] ) at the operator's site, displaying that the gambling causes problems. During the study period, a team of two to three full-time employees carried out these telephone interventions. The studied data came from the AB Svenska Spel Sport & Casino branch, which hosts sports betting, online casino slots and online table games, online poker, and online bingo. The remaining branches, which were not studied here, include AB Svenska Spel 'Tur' ('luck') offering number games and lotteries, and Casino Cosmopol, the independent subcompany responsible of the state-owned land-based casinos. During the study period, the aim was to call all self-testers displaying gambling problems (reaching the 'red' level in GamTest [17] ) and as many high-loss gamblers as possible. The exact definitions and thresholds of the high-loss group were altered over the time of data collection and differentiated with lower thresholds for young gamblers. In an internal post-hoc analysis from Svenska Spel, the average monthly loss of clients selected for the intervention due to high losses was SEK 9202 (Swedish krona, around Euro 900) for clients aged 26 years and above, compared to SEK 1709 (around Euro 170) for clients aged 18 to 25 years.",

One previous research project clearly demonstrated promising effects from a telephone intervention of the Norwegian state-owned gambling operator in gamblers with hazardous gambling habits. In a randomized study of strategies to contact gamblers with high losses [18] , which, in anonymized subjects, followed the gambling operator's own registers, the post-intervention reduction in theoretical gambling loss during 12 months was significantly larger after receiving a telephone intervention compared to a postal letter intervention and compared to a nonintervention control group [19] . Also, a sub-study from the project demonstrated that, within the database of the company assessed, an effect was seen on lottery gamblers even from the postal letter intervention, although, for potentially more addictive gambling types, such as casino gambling and electronic gambling machines, the intervention by telephone was more effective [20] . In this study, however, individuals could not be followed with self-report data, and therefore, data were not able to describe gambling on other gambling operators apart from the one responsible for the intervention. To the best of the authors' knowledge, no other projects have studied the potential effects of a direct interventional contact provided by a gambling operator.",

            "text": "Thus, studies on the effects of responsible gambling intervention are needed. Indeed, more research is required regarding the specific intervention of direct contact with high-risk gamblers. Clearly, the effects on gambling and gambling-related outcome of such an intervention is of uttermost relevance. Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that many individuals with high-risk gambling behaviors are likely not to be reached by a motivational intervention requiring a telephone contact, either because of difficulties of answering the telephone in everyday life or because financial problems caused by gambling may limit individuals' access to the telephone or may make them more prone to use prepaid telephone services and change numbers. However, beyond the studies on actual feasibility and effects, there is also a need for further studies addressing the acceptability and feasibility of such interventions. This includes the need to address the fear of possible negative side effects of such harm-reducing interventions, although research evidence supporting such fears is sparse. While such reactions do not appear to be common in responsible gambling practices, they cannot be excluded and may apply to problem gamblers to a larger extent than nonproblem gamblers [21] . Researchers have highlighted the fact that harm-reducing interventions by gambling operators may be perceived as negative and may be difficult for gamblers to separate from a commercial intent of keeping clients who keep losing money while gambling, referred to as the 'business vs care paradox' [15] . While such a risk could potentially be perceived differently by clients of a noncommercial, public, state-owned gambling operator, the perception of such interventions may still be influenced by the gamblers' impression of the overall gambling market, as the majority of operators are privately owned and commercial. Given the relative paucity of empirical data in the area, such research is still needed.",

Further, during the study period to be included (see below), the COVID-19 pandemic affected gambling markets worldwide, mainly through the reduction of sports events during the earliest phases of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may have also had other consequences on gambling-related behavior and gambling problems. For example, the types of gambling reported in survey studies in the present setting have been subject to at least some changes, most clearly involving a likely decrease in the opportunities for sports betting during the spring of 2020 [22] [23] [24] . While this does not necessarily affect the uptake or effect of responsible gambling tools, the present study also includes the additional aim of (4) assessing whether the objective effects addressed above were altered in any way during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden compared to previous parts of the study period.",

            "text": "AB Svenska Spel is a gambling operator owned entirely by the Swedish state. Historically, in accordance with a previous gambling legislation in Sweden, AB Svenska Spel played the role of an overall gambling monopoly for a broad range of gambling types and as one of the operators in an oligopoly situation for other gambling types (along with one large company offering horse race betting and a number of lotteries, whereas online casino gambling was not allowed). Following the broad introduction of online gambling and a large influx of overseas gambling operators offering mainly online casinos and sports betting online to Swedish customers [25] , the Swedish gambling market was substantially reshaped. A novel legislation has allowed online casinos and other online-based gambling operators to operate from within the Swedish market under regulations by a license system since 1 January 2019. The gambling license requires a number of responsible gambling practices, including the full adherence to a novel Swedish national self-exclusion system, where an individual can electronically self-exclude from all online-based and land-based gambling operators (except a limited number of venues offering the limited-deposit 'restaurant casinos' in restaurants and similar establishments, and gambling types outside the system). The Swedish license gambling market involves a large number of operators in a commercialized market of mainly online casinos and online and land-based sports or horse betting, a smaller number of operators offering restaurant-based casinos with limited deposits, a smaller number of lotteries based mainly on charity organizations and other organizations, monopoly-based state-owned full 'international' casinos in major cities of the country, and a monopoly-based system of land-based electronic gambling machines. AB Svenska Spel has a monopoly role in the major casinos of three (previously four) major cities and state-owned land-based electronic gambling machine markets, as well as a commercial role in land-based and online lotteries and number games, land-based and online sports betting, and online casino and similar chance-based games. The legislation postulates that gambling operators need to identify and intervene in problem gambling. While such interventions were in use prior to this legislation by the state-owned operator (AB Svenska Spel), there is not hitherto a full picture of how this type of harm-reducing efforts may be adopted by different operators.",

However, it is worth noting that the included individuals represent a total population, i.e., all individuals who were reached or attempted to be reached during a full period of time who were judged to apply a relatively stable structure surrounding this novel intervention. In total, 3626 individuals were included in the study. Among them, 1440 were successfully reached, 1542 could not be reached, and 250 individuals were reached but refused to have this motivational intervention (in addition, 30 further individuals were reached but were unable, for other reasons, to have the conversation). Thus, the group reached by the intervention and the control group exceed the size of the two active conditions compared in the Norwegian study by Jonsson et al. [20] , which demonstrated significant differences between the conditions. Also, for example, a predicted modest increase in self-exclusion from 15% of control individuals to 20% of intervention individuals would require two groups of 905 individuals, respectively, for a significant difference to be demonstrated on a p = 0.05 level. Therefore, this sample size was judged to be sufficient for statistically significant findings to be made and for robust conclusions to be drawn. Also, individuals in the intervention group were matched based on the reason for receiving the call. The individuals reached (954 called due to large losses and 234 because of a self-test) were matched (one-to-one) to the individuals who could not be reached (963 due to losses and 268 because of a self-test).",

In the prospective survey study, data will be reported mainly as descriptive statistics, with binary statistical associations between discrete variables collected within the survey. In the retrospective register studies, statistical comparisons will be made comparing the preintervention and postintervention periods and using both unadjusted models and adjusted regression models in order to identify correlates of outcome measures, such as decreases in or discontinuations of gambling activity, the uptake of self-limiting tools, and voluntary self-exclusion. In addition, in a secondary analysis of the retrospective data, individuals successfully reached by the telephone intervention will be compared in a case-control analysis to individuals who were intended for the intervention but were not reached. This case-control analysis will be carried out as a one-to-one matching of reached individuals with non-reached individuals based on the reason for receiving the call due to a high risk score from a taken self-test, and reached individuals will be matched with non-reached individuals with the same discrete intervals of monthly loss.",

One further aspect to be studied is the risk of motivational telephone calls being perceived in a more negative way, such that a caring and motivational approach from a state-owned gambling operator may need to be discussed in relation to previous literature regarding potentially annoying [21] effects or the risk of messages being understood as paradoxically increasing harm instead of the opposite [15] .",

Motivational and harm-reducing interventions carried out by gambling operators represent a research area that has been rarely addressed to date. The project includes-for the first time to the best of the authors' knowledge-a motivational telephone intervention among individuals screening as problem gamblers in a self-test at a gambling operator. Beyond this, the present study also will assess the acceptability of the intervention, thereby providing evidence for the possibility to recommend and implement the present responsible gambling strategy to other gambling operators and to other stakeholders in the area. In addition, in contrast to the limited research experience of such interventions before, this is also the first occasion measuring such an intervention in the subgroup of online poker gamblers. Funding: This research was funded by AB Svenska Spel regarding the conduct of the study interventions and the technical and management expenses surrounding it. Research design, scientific data analyses and web survey data collection, as well as the first author's work, are financed by non-project-specific research grants from AB Svenska Spel and from Svenska Spel Research Council, as well as non-project-specific research grants from the Region Sk\u00e5ne hospital organization.",

The first author holds a position as researcher at Lund University, Sweden, which is sponsored by the state-owned Swedish gambling operator (AB Svenska Spel) and also receives funding in competition from its research council. In addition, he receives research funding from the research councils of the Swedish alcohol monopoly (Systembolaget AB), the Swedish sports federation and the Swedish enforcement authority. He is also involved in a collaboration with Kontigo Care in a clinical study testing that company's products as part of a study assessing digital follow-up tools in the clinical treatment of gambling disorder. In that study, the researcher does not receive any fees from Kontigo Care, but receives non-financial support such that the digital follow-up devices are provided free or charge for the duration of the study. He also has been the national coordinator of a multi-center pharmaco-epidemiological survey study, which was conducted by the independent research institute Research Triangle Institute, United States, which was sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Shire. Shire did not provide any funding for the researcher personally.",
