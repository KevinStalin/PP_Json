Figure S8 includes a number of important processes and for simplicity elides others that are included in the model and that we will describe subsequently. In the figure, we see that people are born into the susceptible compartment S at a rate b. Not shown explicitly, all people face age-specific background mortality rates (\u00b5) from all compartments. People can become infected at a rate \u03bb and enter the exposed compartment E, progressing to becoming infectious I before recovering and entering R. Those who are infected face an excess risk of death from their COVID-19 infections which may be reduced by proper and timely supportive medical care (p d and \u03b1 DX , respectively). The figure shows that the exposed and infectious compartments are stratified by severity level (l = 1, . . . , L) and by whether they have been diagnosed (DX). We ensure realistic distributions of times in E and I by using a multi-compartment structure; specifically, we have multiple E and I compartments, and rates of progression (\u03c3) from E to I and (\u03b3) from I to R that are multiplied by the number of each type of compartments (J and K, respectively). 1 For epidemics like COVID-19, both age-structure and household-structure are important to consider to appropriately capture its dynamics. 2 We next describe how these are incorporated into the model.",

The key components of the household submodel are: 1) once a given household's members are all infected and/or recovered, no further transmission occurs within that household (unless there are births into the household); and 2) if households are not completely isolated from one another such that community transmission is still occurring, then the within-household force of infection (related to the household Secondary Attack Rate, e.g., 4 ) can drive additional community transmission. This occurs through chains of transmission where one household member infects another and then, either member also transmits to individuals in the community who are outside of the household. Through these key features, the household submodel generates a component of the overall force of infection which we term \u03bb HH .

We note that in the absence of mass population screening or random population screening, it is likely that symptomatic individuals (i.e., those in higher severity classes, l = 2) are more likely to be diagnosed and hence diagnosis rates (\u03bd) depend on an individual's symptom status (described in detail in the sections below). While the model also allows for the possibility of diagnosis via active screening (\u03c6), generally we set this rate to 0 for the historic periods to which we are calibrating.",

All of the above groups of demographic parameters are obtainable from public sources for many national and subnational geographic areas (i.e., counties of the United States or states of Mexico). However, adjusted population density deserves specific attention here because of its role in the model inputs and therefore how we specifically compute it. For our modeling purposes, we are interested in population density because we wish to reflect the expected intensity of mixing between people (contacts per unit time) with higher density implying more intense mixing (discussed in further detail in the section on contact matrices below). Because of this, we opt for an alternative definition to those typically used for population density. Instead of defining population density as total population divided by the total area of a given jurisdiction or even the total population divided by the total land area (excluding water and other uninhabitable places), we focus on adjusted (weighted) population density.",

Typically we would then assume that a relatively small number of square miles houses the fraction of the population that is urban multiplied by the total population yielding a high density and that the remaining rural population's average density is its size divided by the remaining land area. We then either model urban and rural populations separately or else take the average of their densities weighted by the fraction of the population that is urban/rural which will generally be higher than just dividing total population by the land area.

What can be computed directly from these observed quantities is the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and its extension, the age-specific CFR. However, the CFR and its age-specific versions are likely overestimates of the corresponding IFRs in many situations. The reasons for this are several. First, CFRs do not include undiagnosed COVID-19 infections and deaths. Second, diagnosis without active surveillance selects for more severe cases which are more likely to die. Below we describe our current approach for quantifying deaths from COVID-19. Furthermore, the overall CFR (or IFR) estimated in one population is also likely to be a biased estimate for other populations if their population age structures -specifically the age structures of COVID-19 cases/infections -differ substantially. This is because the overall CFR (or IFR) is a weighted mean where the weights are proportion of people in each age group at risk. Hence, we prefer the age-specific versions of these quantities, especially when transferring them from one population to another. An additional source of potential bias is that supportive medical care may modify the age-specific probabilities of death from COVID-19, and in some settings (e.g., low resource settings vs. wealthier settings) such differences could also be substantial. While we currently do not have a formal method for correcting for this sort of potential bias, we imagine an approach that incorporates measures/proxies of healthcare system efficacy relevant for conditions like COVID-19 and perhaps differences in mortality for other conditions (e.g., hospitalized pneumonia in general).",

In reality, in many settings, testing is not done on random samples of the population and very likely is concentrated in individuals with more acute illness, those of certain ages, and other characteristics. For this reason, we allow testing rates to differ by such characteristics and over time.

For Mexico City Metropolitan Area, we extend this approach to have these length of stay distributions depend on the date at which hospitalization occurs. From above, IncDX a,t is clearly specific to particular geographic areas. Likewise, the probabilities of hospitalization, the severity and ICU mixture of hospitalized patients, and the length of stays for each patient group likely vary with local geography. Reports on severity, ICU and length of stay include studies by Guan et al. 2020 and Lewnard et al. 2020 among others. 22, 23 In brief, Guan et al. report the number of hospitalized patients within each of their age categories who are severe or non-severe. From these and similar sources, we are able to compute quantities like: the age-specific probability a hospitalized patient was severe; the probability of requiring ICU care conditional on severity (which does not appear to be strongly conditional on age once severity is taken into consideration); and length of stay distributions overall by age as well as distributions of additional time spent in the ICU. These quantities can inform the parameters in the model above (e.g., length of stay estimates inform the CDFs; conditional probabilities of severity inform the proportions facing different lengths of stay; etc.) when direct jurisdiction-specific quantities are unavailable. The likelihood of hospitalization conditional on detection is observed in some data sets (e.g., states of Mexico) but must be calibrated (e.g., counties in California).",

A variety of sources are attempting to measure parts or proxies of this. The simplest are surveys of people asking them about how they have changed a variety of their activities, how much time they spend in their homes, and for what reasons they go out. Simple indirect measures include quantities like the amount of air population measured by area which shows declines in commuter traffic and other production that yields emissions but does not show which types of trips are being curtailed. More sophisticated measures focus on contacts (e.g., the collocation of cellphones based on triangulation from towers or the location information of devices running various apps or the temporal proximity of credit card purchases by different purchasers at the same store) or on mobility with or without collocation (e.g., the fraction of time that someone's device is not in the location it is during typical sleeping hours or the number of devices on public transport, or how far devices travel away from home). Average changes in these measures compared to pre-COVID levels either by individual or by geography all form estimates of components of reductions in contacts sufficient to transmit COVID. For many of these measures, at least in California counties, there are average reductions of 10-70 percent or more which differ by county. What has not been reported to date are measures of individual (or small area) variance of such reductions within county, which are likely important for considering potential transmission among subgroups who must go out of their home (e.g., essential services providers) or who do not comply and then secondary transmission from these groups. Furthermore, when people are mobile or collocate it is not clear from these measures whether they are taking more or less precautions such as masking.",

This involves extracting needed information from mobility data and model calibration (described below). Currently we use multi-location mobility time-series data from sources like Google Mobility Trends and FourSquare to determine when, after NPIs were first implemented, these time-series change. For example, directly after NPI implementation when lock-downs were often in effect, the amount of travel to work locations dropped dramatically but that effect attenuated over the next month or so and then with re-openings and second viral waves may have fluctuated. By analyzing location-specific mobility time-series we determine when there are change-points for the modeled intervention intensity in a given geographic location. However, because changes in mobility patterns do not necessarily correspond to the full range of changes in contacts nor to how people may increase mask use for the same number of contacts, we use model calibration to incidence data to inform the effect sizes for each segment of the time-varying, geography-specific intervention effects. Additionally, we use and have recently made open source and public a dataset containing county-specific information on public health orders, categorized by the type of activity(s) they pertain to and the level of strictness. 24",

            "text": "A challenge for many mathematical simulation models is that they may require input values that are unobserved or unobservable due to financial, practical, or ethical reasons. In such situations, model calibration can be used to infer these values. Specifically, calibration is the process of estimating values for unknown or uncertain parameters of a mathematical model by matching its outputs to observed clinical or epidemiological data (known as calibration targets). The general goal of calibration is to identify set(s) of parameter values that maximize the fit between model outputs and the calibration targets. 25, 26 For the SC-COSMO model, calibration is required for a number of parameters that are not directly observed. These include the community transmission rates (\u03b2 k a ), the household transmission rate (\u03c4 ), the time-varying case detection rates \u03bd E j l and \u03bd I k l , and the time-varying, venue-specific effects of interventions on community transmission rates (\u03ba v t ). Generally priors on parameters are defined based on existing knowledge about their values. 27 As there is substantial uncertainty in these input parameters, we employ uniform prior distributions for each. The prior distributions are uncorrelated, and they are relatively wide to reflect the underlying uncertainty. The prior ranges are defined for particular settings (i.e., the prior ranges for counties in California may differ from those used for the states of Mexico).",

We use two main algorithms to find set(s) of input parameters that cause the model's outputs to match the calibration targets. The first is the incremental mixture importance sampling (IMIS) algorithm, 28, 29 which has been previously used to calibrate deterministic health policy models. [30] [31] [32] An advantage of IMIS over other Monte Carlo methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo, is that with IMIS the evaluation of the likelihood for different sampled parameter sets can be parallelized, which makes its implementation especially suitable for an high-performance computing (HPC) environment such as the ones used for SC-COSMO calibration. The second is the Nelder-Mead (NM) algorithm. 33 This directed search approach is efficient at identifying critical points with complex models because it is gradient-free and guarantees convergence to locally optimal solutions. To identify multiple sets of parameters that are consistent with the calibration targets, we start the NM-based calibration from multiple random starting locations within our prior space. For both algorithms, when we are only interested in identifying a single, best-fit parameter set without running the sampling algorithm, we adopt a Laplace approximation where we compute the posterior mode often called the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, by maximizing the logarithm of the posterior, and use the MAP estimate (instead of the mean) as an approximation of the parameter set \u03b8. The inverse of the negative Hessian of the logarithm of the posterior can be used to measure the uncertainty of this approximation. [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] In the case of the SC-COSMO model, we use not only the mean and hence use the calibrated posterior parameter distributions for projections and analyses of scenarios.",
