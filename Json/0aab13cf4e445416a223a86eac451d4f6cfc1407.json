While geophysical, hydrological, meteorological, climatological and maritime hazards were widely distributed along the Belt and Road regions, many of the Asian and African countries along the regions were underdeveloped and capacities are weak in DRR. These technical constraints were exacerbated by increases in the magnitude and frequency of natural disasters as a result of climate change, which had caused dire economic loss and hindered social development in these countries [16, 17] . ANSO-DRR thus aims to enhance DRR efforts by serving as a platform in connecting people along the Belt and Road regions, focusing on DRR resource development, involving higher education institutions in DRR efforts and increasing disaster resilience in built infrastructures. ANSO-DRR was introduced by Gordon Zhou of IMHE as an international, nonprofit and nongovernmental scientific alliance and a collaborative platform for sustainable development and better promoting the Sendai Framework for DRR and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development along the Belt and Road regions. Currently having 30 members, it was initiated by IMHE-CAS and IDMR of Sichuan University and The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, among other global institutions sharing strong interests in the field of DRR, with its geographical focus on the Belt and Road regions. ANSO-DRR focuses on organizing meetings for leaders of various national and international organizations to exchange on latest DRR theories and practices; contributing to building up open-access, disaster-related data in and across the Belt and Road countries; promoting transnational and multidisciplinary research collaboration in DRR; aligning goals with UN Science and Technology Road Map; forging industrial partnerships; promoting DRR innovations in higher education; and providing DRR advisory support to national governments and regional intergovernmental bodies. ANSO-DRR was officially approved by ANSO on 11 December 2019.",

ANSO has 53 members in more than 40 countries, with a vision to become an international science organization of significant impact in the promotion of shared development and advances of United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the implementation of concrete programs, initiatives and actions in science, technology, innovation and capacity building (STIC). It supports the following activities: education and capacity building; international science cooperation in areas of major importance for SDGs; international cooperation for livelihood, health and well-being; assessment for support in science policies and advice; and technology transfer. ANSO's governance is comprised of the Presidents of Chinese Academy of Science (ANSO President), Pakistan Academy of Science (ANSO Vice-President) and Russian Academy of Science (ANSO Vice-President). Since its formal establishment in November 2018, ANSO has built up its own website and newsletter (ANSO Update) and published a strategic plan. Current ANSO programs include ANSO scholarships for young talents (200 master's students and 300 doctoral students), ANSO training program (supporting 10 training workshops outside of China annually for ANSO members), ANSO fellowships, ANSO associations (operational arms for ANSO), ANSO collaborative research, ANSO prize (for Chinese scholars having received higher degrees from overseas to work in China) and workshops/conferences. ANSO associations aim to enhance the impact and operation of ANSO in major areas, mobilize and use resources and efforts more effectively, integrate and network scientists and units of different countries and allow easy and effective collaboration. ANSO-DRR was the second association supported by ANSO, which saw great potential for ANSO-DRR, with ANSO-DRR's abundant resources and pool of experts. The ANSO platform could be used for ANSO-DRR to collaborate with other ANSO associations. For example, ANSO crosscutting platform aimed to establish the basic sciences, green and sustainable development, health and disease, science-based strategic advice and technology transfer by utilizing ANSO research and ANSO capacity building programs. ANSO has formulated the following targets: (1) establishing joint funding mechanism among ANSO members and partners, (2) coming up with innovative ideas on transboundary cooperation to bring in more active institutions and scientists and (3) cooperating with key international organizations at actual program level.",

The first is its commitment to transdisciplinary approaches, and the second is the focus on coupling science and technology research with capacity development. With respect to the latter, the major challenge of multinational partnerships involved a large imbalance among partners in access to resources. A model in which countries could contribute according to their capacity was called for. Mechanisms for co-funding projects were proposed: half-half, in which ANSO's support would be based on the funding capacity of the collaborator; in-kind support for capacity building (e.g., funding local costs of meetings/trainings); and co-funding of scholarships between ANSO and partner institutes.",

As to the question on the links of ANSO-DRR and the International Association for Disaster Risk Reduction (IADRR) [18] , the common focuses on developing young scientists and the mapping of worldwide research activities were stressed. ANSO-DRR would also focus on clearer, more concrete and specific topics that the ANSO country members could utilize findings to similar projects (e.g. the Institute of Atmospheric Sciences used a multimodel for seasonal prediction and disseminated it to ANSO members). Regarding the question of whether topics on energy, power generation, transmission and mobile communications were covered by ANSO, it was confirmed that ANSO was preparing the energy corridor, an opportunity for collaboration in these areas.",

Multicountry and regional collaboration, as well as transdisciplinary approaches, were highlighted. The following strengths of ANSO-DRR were also underscored: high-level participation of national academies of sciences, provision of strong opportunities for transnational collaboration, involvement of the top research institutions in the respective regions and its strong geographic focus. A challenge for ANSO-DRR was to develop a strategy for collaborating with and adding value to existing networks (e.g., the Global Alliance of Disaster Research Institutes (GADRI), the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP) and ANSO itself), rather than duplicating the work of other networks. As a result, the next goals of ANSO-DRR's work were identified: creating better linkages between DRR communities and health emergency management (i.e., health emergency and disaster risk management (Health-EDRM)) communities [19, 20] , focusing on involvement of youth and young professional networks, promoting greater collaboration with engineering communities and professional societies in DRR and contributing to policy development. For ANSO-DRR to achieve these goals, a powerful knowledge platform for sharing information was called for. The need for ANSO-DRR to develop a DRR strategy in the context of COVID-19 was also emphasized. Moreover, data collection on existing mechanisms and changes in each member's agenda in relation to COVID-19 was identified as an essential step in order to move forward.",
