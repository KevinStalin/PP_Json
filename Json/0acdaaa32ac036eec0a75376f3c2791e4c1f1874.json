The Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) has attempted to meet that growing need by a set of recommendations, applying \"clinical soundness\" as a beacon standard; that approach tends to prioritize patients with higher life expectancy, which could be characterized as a \"moderately utilitarian\" approach. Yet, such a selection has engendered daunting ethical quandaries. The authors believe it can only be warranted and acceptable if rooted in a transparent decision-making process and verifiable, reviewed criteria. Moreover, the authors have stressed how clinical experimentation in a pandemic setting is a subtext of great interest from an ethical perspective. In Italy, no drug therapy and trials were undertaken for COVID-19 patients for a rather long period of time. When the epidemic was already circulating, an intervention proved necessary on the system of administrative procedures, aimed at expediting the authorization and validation of protocols, then bogged down by bureaucracy. A new system has since been instituted by a government decree that was signed about one month after the first Covid-19 case was officially recorded in the country. Such a swift implementation, which took just a few weeks, is noteworthy and proves that clinical trials can be initiated in a timely fashion, even with a pandemic unfolding. The concerted, action of supportive care and RCTs is the only way to attain effective forms of treatments for COVID-19 and any other future outbreak.",

Patient selection criteria ought to be grounded in the principles of preparedness, adequacy and the capability to meet current needs. If the preparedness-based strategy should turn out to be lacking in terms of ensuring the highest benefit to every patient, those for which the treatment can be more effective and with the higher chances of surviving should be prioritized; that assessment needs to take into account not only patients who are physically in the facilities, but also those examined at an earlier time and found to be in critical conditions. The CNB opinion has not been unanimously approved: a minority position has in fact criticized the vague and illdefined nature of the \"higher chances of survival\" standard, arguing that in cases of identical clinical evaluations, it would be far preferable to apply the standard of \"higher life expectancy\", in agreement with the SIAARTI position [7] .",

The clinical records for such patients point to elevated D-dimer levels along with fibrinogen decreases and lower platelet levels, and a deterioration of coagulation factors, which is consistent with the histopathological outcome of capillary microtrombosis.

With the current COVID-19 pandemic, RCTs have been launched around the world, including an adaptive trial sponsored by the NIH [17] . In Italy, with the epidemic already running for weeks, it has proven necessary to intervene on administrative procedures in order to expedite the system of authorization and validation of protocols, which was bogged down by bureaucracy. The new, streamlined system has been phased in through a government decree that was enacted about one month after the first Covid-19 case had been recorded in the country [18] . Such systemic dysfunctions have however delayed the start of controlled experimentation of new forms of treatment, and that by itself may have contributed to the high fatality rate.",

Ultimately, the high fatality rate could have been brought on by factors other than high average population age, including therapeutic choices. As for the daunting challenges arising from the need to ration scarce emergency care resources, the current scenario has driven the definition of new \"professional-behavioral standards\", in the form of new recommendations and guidelines from scientific societies and health care institutions. In that regard, two prominent criteria have been outlined: higher survival rates in the short term, and life expectancy (taking into account comorbidities). Both such standards have been deemed ethically acceptable; yet each one of them is liable to be called into question and criticized, as it is generally the case when facing ethical quandaries of such a magnitude. From a merely practical standpoint, guidelines and official recommendations, specific ones for each professional setting, need to be complied with; it is nonetheless just as essential to guarantee a high degree of transparency in the decision-making process, the thorough documentation of the motives determining each and every decision, and accessibility of such elements for each party involved in the process. Any failure to prioritize such pivotal aspects may entail allegations of individual rights violations, and even result in medico-legal consequences.",
