A significant change occurred in 2018, when, for the first time since we began tracking publication numbers, the number of publications featuring \"Rice\" or\"Oryza\" was greater than those featuring Arabidopsis. This might indicate that technological advances in genome sequencing, bioinformatics and gene-editing, amongst others have recently facilitated research in crop species and that discoveries made in Arabidopsis are now being more effectively translated. This is reinforced by a review by Provart et al. (2016) , which surveyed 54,033 Arabidopsis papers and found that in the majority of years, more than 50% of the cited Arabidopsis papers from a given year were referenced by papers in which the research focused on a species other than Arabidopsis. This was determined by the absence of \"Arabidopsis\" in the taxonomic data available for each paper.",

While numbers of publications on Arabidopsis are steady or falling in some countries, this is offset by the increase in publications coming from Chinese labs, which shows no slow-down since trending upward a decade ago. Therefore, despite a general admission that there is movement toward more applied research, it is encouraging that many country representatives are positive about the state of Arabidopsis research in their home country. This is exemplified by a response from Belgium; \"\u2026.plant scientists feel an increasing pressure from funding agencies, universities, and research institutes to focus on more applied research aspects. This being said, it is likely that Arabidopsis will remain a major tool to generate and test hypothesis even in applied research projects.\" Globally, Arabidopsis clearly remains a critical experimental model for understanding \"how plants work,\" which will lead to technological advances and knowledge increases that feed into applied projects in a variety of crop plants.",

The European Infrastructure for Plant Phenotyping (EMPHASIS) project is arguably the most interesting development in this area. When it becomes fully operational in 2022 EMPHASIS will place plant phenotyping in a position to obtain centralized European funding through similar mechanisms to those that support other large European infrastructure projects such as the Square Kilometre Array for radio astronomy (although plant phenotyping is much cheaper, http://roadm ap2018.esfri.eu/).",

MASC Country representatives provide an opinion on the current status of Arabidopsis research in their countries. It is challenging to obtain a consistent metric for these evaluations as different countries will view their situation from different starting positions. For example, the United Kingdom publishes around 200 Arabidopsis papers per year and there is ~\u00a38M in annual 'Responsive mode' Government funding for \"Arabidopsis research\" yet this represents a reduction in funding, so the situation is not as healthy as in previous years. However, other countries have low to no funding in research specifically dedicated to Arabidopsis, yet have a positive opinion toward research in this area, for example, \"In Brazil even though there is virtually no such funding programs towards Arabidopsis, the number of institutions using Arabidopsis in their research is growing each year. We are seeing a gradual increase in the usage of Arabidopsis as a model plant for molecular and genetic studies due to its power as an easily manipulated model system to investigate gene functions.\" Similarly in India, although there is no earmarked financial support for Arabidopsis research from the Government, scientists can compete for grants dedicated for basic science and many projects are regularly funded on Arabidopsis exclusively; \"many more projects use Arabidopsis as a system to validate genes from crop plants.
