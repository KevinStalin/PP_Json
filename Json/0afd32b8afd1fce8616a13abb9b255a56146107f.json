            "text": "Infectious disease outbreaks have occurred sporadically over the centuries. The most significant ones of this century, as reported by the World Health Organization, include the EVD epidemic, SARS pandemic, Swine Flu pandemic and MERS pandemic. The long-term mental health consequences of outbreaks are as profound as physical ones and can last for years post-outbreak. This highlights the need for enhancing the preparedness of pragmatic mental health service provision. Due to its magnitude, the novel COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be the most impactful. Compared with previous outbreaks, COVID-19 has also occurred at higher rates in frontline staff in addition to patients. As COVID-19 is more contagious than earlier outbreaks, there is a need to identify infected people quickly and isolate them and their contacts. This is the current context in which mental health services including IAPT have had to operate. Evidently, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) services are a major mental health service provider in the UK that have demonstrated variability in their response to COVID-19. While some IAPT services quickly adapted their existing strengths and resources (e.g. remote working), other services were less prepared. To date, there are no clear unitary guidelines on how IAPT services can use their pre-existing resources to respond to the long-term effects of outbreaks. In light of this, the current paper aims to reflect on the lessons learned from past outbreaks in order to consider how an enhanced remit of IAPT might integrate with other services to meet the long-term needs of patients and staff affected by COVID-19.",

These interventions are evidence based and recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). The IAPT services are commissioned by the NHS as part of primary care. Over the years, IAPT has responded to community need and has evolved its services to encompass cultural adaptation. In line with NHS long-term plans, IAPT has also developed its integrated physical and mental health service provision for long-term conditions such as diabetes (NHS, 2019) . Service provision by IAPT has also widened multidisciplinary team (MDT) working with GPs, community services and research institutions.

This can range from small localised communities or countries (epidemic), or thousands of people across continents (pandemic).

In relation to this definition, public effort has focused on physical health response. However, as pointed out by Dong and Bouyey (2020) , mental health service preparedness needs to be integrated into this wider preparedness programme.

In this report consultant psychiatrist Dr Andrew Molodynski reported that the sheer numbers of mortality and helplessness was a catalyst for symptoms of anxiety, depression and trauma reactions.

Several psychological professional bodies and services including the BPS (2020), OXCADAT (2020) and the COVID Trauma Response Group (e.g. Billings et al., 2020) have provided guidelines and tools for working in this context. However, there are no current unitary guidelines on how IAPT can manage the long-term impact of COVID-19. However, in line with Fig. 1 , as we head towards the postpandemic stage, there is a need for a sustained pragmatic approach to IAPT service provision.

For example, in their study on SARS, Mak et al. (2009) suggest an integrated multidisciplinary approach to management of complex PTSD cases. This is due to the complex interaction of the biopsychosocial post-pandemic long-term effects. This is in line with the suggestions of other authors, for example, in a summary of the Disaster Mental Health Subcommittee's observations of the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic, Pfefferbaum et al. (2012) highlighted lessons on the importance of an integrated approach to mental and behavioural issues of outbreaks. They also emphasised psychological interventions which focused on addressing fear of uncertainty, enhancing resilience and fostering adaptive behaviours. They also highlighted lessons on the need for public education about how people's mental health and behaviour might be affected by outbreaks and sources of help. Similarly, in their review article on pandemics, Morganstein et al. (2017) summarised lessons on the main areas for long-term outbreak interventions. These include identification of undesirable health-risk behaviours and educating communities on how to build resilience and adapt desirable health-risk behaviours. It also includes managing misinformation and stigma. These findings are comparable to those outlined in the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services Psychosocial Services preparedness framework for pandemic influenza (2020). This framework emphasises lessons on meeting patients' mental health needs including tackling anxiety and fear of uncertainty and PTSD. They also emphasise educating the public and managing misinformation, MDT working, involving communities and development of telemental health. 'Telemental health' (e.g. digital therapy, e-therapy) is the application of information and communications technologies including telephone, online courses and videoconferencing, to deliver mental health care remotely, including medical consultations and psychotherapy (Waugh et al., 2015) .",

They adapted the stepped-care model using wellbeing workshops followed by intervention if needed (e.g. BSMFT, 2020). Many IAPT services have also been adapting their way of working under social distancing and lockdown measures during the acute phase of COVID-19 including remote working via telemental health (e.g. ELFT, 2020). As lockdown eases, services have now started preparing for the aftermath of COVID-19. For example, some services have laid out clear integrated system response plans to build capacity, involve communities, apply digital therapies and reduce inequalities (e.g. ELHCP, 2020). Another example of an integrated MDT approach to mental health is demonstrated by the new Positive Minds mental health service. This provision is a partnership between the local NHS, CCG, City Council, and the voluntary, community and social enterprise sector (PCCG, 2020). The aim of this way of working is to offer a flexible and comprehensive service. These are just a few examples of services across the country. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that most IAPT services are now working to optimise their way of working in the context of COVID-19. In line with the above lessons, and the anticipated significance of PTSD cases, some services have started to prepare for treatment models. For example, have recently adapted a CBT protocol for treating patients with PTSD following ICU. This protocol has adapted the Ehlers and Clark (2000) cognitive model of PTSD so that it can be applied to post-ICU PTSD. This model has reflected on the trauma processes relevant to ICU in relation to COVID-19 and outlines how the PTSD model can be adapted. This protocol has also included provisions to carry out treatment remotely. They also point out the applicability of this protocol to other traumas. Another point for consideration for less complex traumas might be the recently published group TF-CBT protocol for homogeneous traumas (Skilbeck and Spanton, 2020) . This group therapy might be beneficial in increasing surge capacity and enhancing normalisation.",

This was a stepped-care approach consisting of several provisions. These included psychoeducation, group wellbeing workshops and individual therapy interventions that were supported by strong leadership. Similarly Maunder et al. (2010) described the benefits of computer-assisted resilience training for healthcare worker preparedness for flu pandemics. The programme consisted of several modules including psychoeducation, relaxation, self-assessment and resilience building. This resilience training approach for healthcare workers was also reported by Aiello et al. (2011) . They used face-to-face group training sessions with a focus on stressors as well as approaches to building resilience and enhancing stress management as facilitated. Another beneficial lesson from the past was from the SARS outbreak. In this case, a Toronto hospital applied staff drop-in psychological support sessions (Maunder et al., 2003) . They also recommended remote psychological support such as phone or Skype, especially where there was a need to have as few people on site as possible.",

As outlined in the above lessons, this model emphasises staff psychological first aid focused on recognising the early warning signs of distress in staff and providing support in order to prevent the development of diagnosable mental health disorders whilst also planning for appropriate psychological intervention where needed. These lessons have been further implemented within IAPT service provision. For example, the Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) pathway delivered by Talk Changes (Hackney & City IAPT) has been developed from the EPSS model (Cole et al., 2020) . This is a three-phase programme consisting of psychoeducation, low-intensity group therapy and individual CBT interventions. In line with Fig. 1 , this model provides an example of how COVID-19 peri-pandemic distress has been addressed for frontline staff using existing resources and infrastructures. The authors anticipate that the application of this model will also be useful in the post pandemic stage of COVID-19.

They also highlight that access issues can also be addressed by considerations around socioeconomic and cultural factors. Similarly, a publication in the Lancet on lessons to be learned from the HIV pandemic highlighted the importance of considering health inequalities, in particular older patients and BAME groups (Hargreaves et al., 2020) . They emphasise responsive tracking of patient vulnerabilities including socioeconomic status. They advocate means of reaching all patients, especially the hard to reach. They also advise pragmatic approaches that promote behaviour change via MDT interventions and meaningful involvement of communities.",

For example, some IAPT services have been working to identify areas of inequality and need by engaging health and wellbeing boards and local councils to help lead and advise on addressing areas of social inequality (e.g. ELHCP, 2020). There has been consideration for assessments to capture any inequality, for example improving access by identifying digitally excluded populations whilst working within the COVID-19 context. There are also plans to engage patients, e.g. BAME communities and staff, where COVID-19 appears to have had a disproportionate impact and review COVID-19 effects on mental health, health and behaviour change needs. In terms of behaviour change, areas such as anchor programmes, e.g. apprenticeships, have been considered to bridge the gap. Anecdotal evidence suggests that other services have been applying similar models.",

Main areas for consideration are taking a pragmatic approach, integrating with other services and responding to community needs. Meeting these needs necessitates community engagement and responding to the needs of staff. With the isolation measures imposed by COVID-19, this paper has highlighted the importance of integrating telemental health into IAPT routine practice. Telemental health is also recommended by the NICE guidelines. For example, in the case of PTSD, they have recommended that there is enough evidence that online and videoconferencing trauma-focused CBT can be as effective as face-to-face therapy (NICE, 2018) . Telemental health has been a topic of interest in IAPT services for several years (Thew, 2020) . Furthermore, Whaibeh et al. (2020) argue that telemental health has demonstrable effectiveness, convenience and reliability, and that it is an essential mode of service provision to be integrated into routine practice. These implementations also integrate with the wider NHS long-term plan. It is imperative that IAPT services continue to adapt a pragmatic approach for non-COVID-19 common mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, panic, OCD and health anxiety, in the context of social distancing measures. Given the undetermined aftermath of COVID-19, this pragmatic and cyclical responsiveness by IAPT will enable it to meet the needs of those affected by COVID-19 whilst also sustaining a wider service.",

However, there are currently no unitary records of IAPT service responsiveness to the mental health impacts of COVID-19.
