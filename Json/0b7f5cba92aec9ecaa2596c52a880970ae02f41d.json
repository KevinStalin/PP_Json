They worked long, exhausting hours in rapidly changing healthcare settings; filling unfamiliar roles; making demoralizing life-and-death decisions; and battling a poorly understood new virus. Workers had limited treatment options for patients and available options had limited validation. During this pandemic, some likened healthcare delivery to war. A battle was fought at the front lines to save lives, but healthcare worker casualties were not always easy to identify.",

This was a high priority mission intended to promote the overall effort to deliver optimal care to patients infected by COVID-19. It proved difficult to reach the people who were struggling the most, i.e., people whose stoicism, exhaustion, isolation, concerns about privacy, or commitment to work overshadowed their attention to self-care. To create a system that addressed these challenges, we: 1) united independent efforts across our campus into an integrated support system; 2) created an array of services to build a safety net to support struggling individuals; 3) initiated a proactive outreach program; 4) redeployed trainees and faculty; and 5) identified volunteers to provide needed services. Further, we accomplished this task quickly and without hiring new staff.",

In response, multiple programs emerged within the Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and Yale Medicine (YM), its faculty practice, as well as its affiliated hospital, Yale-New Haven Health (YNHH), which is embedded within the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS). These initiatives built on multiple pre-COVID initiatives within several YSM and YNHHS departments and programs. We recognized that these entities needed to collaborate in order to integrate the initiatives into a well-coordinated system. This led to thrice weekly meetings with the heads of these groups under the leadership of the chair of the Department of Psychiatry (JHK) and the emergence of a wonderfully collaborative effort that worked through a consensus process to provide supports to healthcare workers in our community.",

Also, it was extremely important to support the collaboration among the leadership dyads as the distinct stresses of the doctor and nurse roles on the COVID-19 Units had the potential to create resentment, mistrust, and to break down communication and collaboration.

The real solution is to expand in-home childcare resources (including a central coordination and training of in-home childcare professionals) now and in advance of the emergence of any future pandemic so that healthcare working parents can obtain the support they need.",

Both of these issues highlighted longstanding tensions in our community related to disparities in the racial composition of our faculties, leadership groups, and in many of our training programs. The result was heightened distress experienced across our healthcare community, particularly so for our Healthcare Workers of Color.

Counseling or formal treatment can also be an essential part of resuming a full and rewarding life. After extremely stressful events, approximately 5%-10% of people will experience a delayed onset of stress symptoms [28, 29] . Two groups, in particular, are at increased risk for persisting or delayed symptoms. People with psychiatric disorders may experience COVID-19 related stress more intensely [30] , increasing their risk for illness exacerbation. Also, COVID-19 infection may trigger a persisting proinflammatory state that contributes to persisting depression-like symptoms [31, 32] .",

Managing mental illness had not been an explicit priority in medical school or hospital initiatives aimed at increasing wellness, reducing burnout, or increasing institutional alignment. However, symptoms of mental illness were a common consequence of serving as a healthcare worker, with 30-40% manifesting moderate-to-severe symptoms on our questionnaire. Yet, as was evident in the 20% completion rate for the stress self-assessment questionnaires and the paltry utilization of one-to-one support, we have a long way to go to create a culture where active engagement in self-care is considered an obligation of membership in the healthcare J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f community. Further, we need to do a better job of engaging leaders, at all levels, in promoting the mental health self-care of their teams. High rates of people were suffering emotionally during the COVID-19 pandemic and many continue to suffer. Prior to COVID-19, we were not well-prepared to deal with the psychological impact of a disaster on our community, or its overall mental health. Our experience attempting to respond to this need highlighted both opportunities and continuing challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a time for transformative change in healthcare. Perhaps this crisis is an opportunity to create better infrastructure and culture change so that we can do a better job of addressing the ongoing mental health needs of healthcare workers.

Overall stress was assessed using the following items: loss of confidence in managing work, family, and life demands; exposure to death or threat of death for self and loved ones; feeling out of control; feeling guilty or ashamed; and blaming others for their distress. Stress symptom scores: 0-4 (mild), 5-9 (moderate), 10-17 (high).
