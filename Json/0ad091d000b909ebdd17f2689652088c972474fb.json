Rats were randomized to receive transfusion of RBCs, FFPs, and platelets in a 1:1:1 ratio to achieve a MAP of 70 mmHg, with or without the addition of ADAMTS-13 (50 \u03bcg/kg). Blood samples were assessed for biochemistry and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM). Syndecan-1 and VE-cadherin levels were measured as a reflection of endothelial integrity. The amount of leakage of dextran-FITC from the vascular system to the parenchyma in lungs was quantified. To assess inflammation, IL-6 and IL-8 levels were determined. Organ damage was assessed by histopathology.",

When endothelial integrity gets disrupted, glycocalyx constituents such as syndecan-1 and vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin are shed into the circulation. Elevated levels are detected in traumatically injured patients, suggesting a loss of endothelial integrity [4] [5] [6] . Currently, the pathophysiology of endothelial dysfunction in trauma is not fully understood. It was postulated that the ratio of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to ADAMTS-13 (a desintegrin and metalloprotease with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) may play an important role [7] [8] [9] . After injury, vWF is shed from endothelial cells and mediates platelet adhesion at sites of vascular injury. Monomers of vWF can bind together to form ultra-large von Willebrand factor (ULvWF)-multimers that have the ability to form thrombi spontaneously, due to a very high platelet-binding affinity [10] . The enzyme ADAMTS-13 regulates the size of vWF by cleaving the ULvWF multimers, thereby preventing excess thrombi formation, resulting in a balanced hemostasis.",

Clinical studies in trauma patients support this notion of endothelial improvement after plasma transfusion [18] .

Animals lived in standard cages under normal conditions of a 12:12-h light:dark cycle and received standard lab chow and water ad libitum. Rats were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of KDA (ketamine (1.8 mL 100 mg/mL; Nimatek\u00ae, Eurovet Animal Health BV, Bladel, Netherlands), dexmedetomidine (0.5 mL 0.5 mg/mL; Dexdomitor\u00ae, Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland), atropine (0.2 mL 0.5 mg/mL; Pharmachemie BV, Haarlem, Netherlands) and 0.5 mL of NaCl 0.9%), tracheotomized and connected to a mechanical ventilator for the duration of the entire experiment (Babylog 8000, Dr\u00e4ger) [21] . Atropine was administered to prevent respiratory problems due to salivary and excessive bronchial secretions. Maintenance anesthesia consisted of 50 mg/kg ketamine and a pain stimulus was administered every hour to evaluate the level of anesthesia. Body temperature was continuously monitored and controlled by placing the rats on a heated surface set to 37\u00b0C. Polytrauma was induced by performing a midline laparotomy, after which the left and medial liver lobes and 5 cm of the small intestine were crushed using a surgical clamp covered with silicone tubing. Subsequently, the right femur was fractured using a blunt guillotine. By cannulating the carotid artery, the rats were monitored and hemorrhaged until a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 40 mmHg was reached. After 45 min in a shock state with severe hypotension, rats were transfused at a rate of 8-12 mL/hour in a 1:1:1 ratio of RBC: FFP:PLT through a catheter in the jugular vein. Resuscitation continued until a MAP of 70 mmHg was reached. To objectify the amount of endothelial leakage, rats were infused with a dextran marker of 70 kDa labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (0.5 mL 100 mg/mL in NaCl 0.9%; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) 30 min before exsanguination.

Administration of ADAMTS-13 improved shock reversal in our experimental model, as reflected by a higher MAP, attenuated lactate levels, and a lower base deficit. As we found a trend towards less shedding of glycocalyx constituents into the circulation, this may have been caused by an improved endothelial barrier integrity. In line with this, a protective effect of recombinant ADAMTS-13 on the endothelial barrier function was previously described in a model of traumatic brain injury [26] . However, we could not demonstrate a decrease in vascular leakage of FITC-labeled dextran, nor an improvement in organ failure. This may have been due to a short acting effect of ADAMTS-13, necessitating repeated administration. Alternatively, the model may have lasted too short to demonstrate protection of ADAMTS-13 on the organ level.",

Improved clot formation most likely was not due to an effect of fibrinogen, as FIBTEM MCF levels throughout the experiment did not differ significantly between groups and fibrinogen levels at exsanguination were also similar. A beneficial effect of ADAMTS-13 on trauma-induced coagulopathy is in line with findings in a model of traumatic brain injury, in which ADAMTS-13 led to reduction in consumption coagulopathy in ADAMTS-13 depleted mice [26] . In our experiment, we found that the effect of the ADAMTS-13 was most clear up to 2 h post-injury. Recombinant human ADAMTS-13 seems to be particularly active in the first 45 min after administration in a single bolus, as was shown in a model investigating therapeutic restoration of ADAMTS-13 levels in rats with neutralizing anti-ADAMTS-13 antibodies [27] . This might explain the fact that the observed improved platelet function in the ADAMTS-13 group did not last until the end timepoint of the experiment. In line with this thought, platelet levels were not different between groups at the end of the experiment. The duration of the experiment may have been too short for ADAMTS-13 to prevent a decline in platelet counts, since this process is time dependent, as was shown in a first-in-human, multicenter dose escalation study in which platelet counts changed after approximately 24 h [28] . Alternatively, it should be noted that platelet counts in rats differ from men, with markedly higher values [29] .",

Also, micro-thrombi formation is not detectable in histology in this model. Also, the model resulted in dropout of animals, reducing the power.
