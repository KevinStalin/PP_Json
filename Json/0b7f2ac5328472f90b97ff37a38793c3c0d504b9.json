ConclusionsCOVID-19 Pandemic is ongoing, and to know how far the virus has spread in Niger State, Nigeria, a pilot study was carried out to determine the COVID-19 Seroprevalence, patterns, dynamics, and risk factors in the state. The seroprevalence of COVID-19 in Niger State was found to be 25.41% and 2.16% for the positive IgG and IgM respectively. Seroprevalence among age groups, gender and by occupation varied widely due to the differences in mobility and activity as well as the occupational exposures and hazards. The COVID-19 asymptomatic rate in the state was found to be 46.81%. The risk analyses showed that the chances of infection .
