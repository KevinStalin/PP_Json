We aimed to investigate the relationship between genotypes of CYP3A4*1B and treatment response and prognosis of MM. Seventytwo patients diagnosed with MM between January 2016 and 2020 and 100 healthy people to create a control group participated in our study. Genotypes were classified in 3 separate groups as NN, MN, and MM. Both PFS and OS were significantly higher in the NN genotype (p = 0.001, p = 0.014). Being under the age of 65 was 27.988 times more protective for OS and 4.496 times for PFS (p = 0.006, p = 0.017). NN genotype was shown to be 41.666-fold protective for OS and 3.144-fold protective for PFS (p = 0.004, p = 0.030). This study demonstrated that CYP3A4*1B NN genotype, which is an important cytochrome p450 member for the treatment of MM, was 41.666-fold protective for OS and 3.144-fold protective for PFS. It was shown in this study for the first time in the literature as a valuable contribution.",

            "text": "Cytochrome P450 is one of the large and functional enzyme families composed of various hemoproteins. While it was initially thought that \"p450\" was a single cytochrome found only in the liver and its role was to process drugs and other synthetic exogenous substances, this protein network has been shown to play a role in many treatment steps in current practices [5] . The P450 family is subdivided according to the amino acid similarity between them, arranged in a way that it helps families and subfamilies according to the percentage of amino acid similarity. When the similarity is 40% and above, the same digit subfamily is also grouped; 55% and above are grouped in a certain subfamily formed with the same letter [6, 7] . Human genome consists of 18 different types of p450 families. It is seen that this family has subfamilies consisting of 41 separate, different, variety proteins encoded by 57 genes. It is classified as an individual gene/isoenzyme/isozyme/isoform. For example, CYP1A1 refers to CYP family 1, subfamily A, and protein 1 in a subfamily. Gene and cDNA are written in italics (CYP1A1), while mRNA and protein are shown in the normal uppercase font (CYP1A1) [8, 9] . The cytochrome p450 system (CYP) is divided into two main classes: those involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics and those involved in the biosynthesis of endogenous compounds [9] . CYPs are mainly monooxygenases that mediate hydroxylation and oxidation reactions that increase the hydrophilicity of CYP substrates. This results in either the activation of prodrugs or the increased clearance and excretion of chemotherapeutic agents by the kidneys. CYP has a great role in the metabolism of chemotherapeutics. Approximately 80% of all therapeutic drugs are mainly metabolized by members of the CYP1, CYP2, or CYP3 families, and 50% of this percentage is metabolized only by members of the CYP3A subfamily [10] . The human locus for the CYP3A gene cluster is located on chromosome 7q21-q22. It consists of two pseudogenes (CYP3AP1 and CYP3AP2) and four genes (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP3A7, and CYP3A43). Each of the four functional genes in the CYP3A locus contains 13 exons [11] .",

It is responsible for most of the metabolic activities attributed to the CYP3A subfamily [10] [11] [12] . CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 expression levels are comparable in many cancers, higher than non-tumor tissues [10, 13] . This leads them to be seen as the target of chemotherapeutic and other anticancer mechanisms. An important factor influencing CYP3A4 expression and activity is the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs are genetic differences in which a position in a gene is occupied by different nucleotides and each resulting variation is within the population. The biological results of some SNPs can cause sharp variations in enzyme expression and activity. This can lead to differences in drug response, toxicity, bioavailability, and clearance among patients. We can see in the literature that CYP3A4*1B is reported to be present in men with more advanced prostate cancer [14] .",

CYP3A4*1A, which is the wild-type allele of CYP3A4, is seen predominantly in the general population. The first discovered SNP variant CYP3A4*1B (rs2740574; A > G substitution in 5\u2032 promoter region) is seen as another SNP in 66% of the African-American community, in 4% of Europeans, but it is not seen in Asians [12] .

It enables docetaxel to be inactivated by converting to its hydroxylated derivatives. A high CYP3A4 activity will result in poor therapeutic efficacy of the drug. Therefore, a 49% reduction in docetaxel clearance was observed in cancer patients treated with docetaxel in combination with the active CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole [16] . CYPA3A4 mainly plays a role in the metabolism of drugs such as nitroarene, triazole, heterocyclic amine, azoaromatic amine, N-heterocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, dibenzocarbazole, estradiol derivative; estrogen, contraceptive, nitrosamine, and triphenylethyleneamine and also plays a role in the metabolism of drugs such as antiestrogens and estrogen receptor modulators [5, 17] . Apart from this group of drugs, bexarotene, busulfan, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, docetaxel, doxorubicin, etoposide, ifosfamide, imatinib mesylate, tretinoin, vinblastine, vincristine, and vinorelbine are also involved in the mechanism of chemotherapeutics, which are widely used in hematological malignancies. However, we see that the literature data are limited especially in terms of treatment responses with OS and PFS. In this context, it is possible to say that the data presented for the first time in the literature were detected in our study. Examining the literature data between the treatments of the patients included in our study and their relationship with p450 seems important in terms of explaining the significant differences we obtained in terms of OS and PFS. It is necessary to mention the publications on the relationship between bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone, lenalidomide, and the p450 enzyme system and melphalan used in ASCT [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

In an important study, co-administration of ketoconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, has been shown to increase the mean bortezomib exposure by 35% in patients. Hellman et al. [19] , the effects of co-administration of dexamethasone, a weak CYP3A4 inducer and rifampin or rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, on the pharmacokinetics and safety of bortezomib in patients with MM and NHL were evaluated. Co-administration of rifampicin resulted in a 45% decrease in bortezomib concentration, while concurrent administration of dexamethasone had no significant effect. The results of these two important studies are also very guiding for our study. Considering that the effect of dexamethasone used with bortezomib is not significant, our SNP findings in the CYP3A4 system may be thought to be closely related to bortezomib.",

In an important study on DDI of pomalidomide [24] , its relationship with the p450 system was investigated. Co-administration of oral Data written in bold was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05) **PD pomalidomide, dexamethasone, Cd carfilzomib, dexamethasone [24] . Carfilzomib, an irreversible proteasome inhibitor, has a favorable safety profile and significant anti-tumor activity in relapsed and refractory MM. In a study about DDI of carfilzomib [25] , the clinical pharmacokinetics (PK), metabolism, and DDI profile of carfilzomib are summarized. Carfilzomib has been found to be largely extrahepatically cleared by peptidase cleavage and epoxide hydrolysis. Cytochrome P450-mediated metabolism played a minor role, suggesting that co-administration of p450 inhibitors or inducers is unlikely to alter the PK profile. When we examine the results of our patients and the relationship between these two drugs, it is necessary to start by emphasizing that significantly more PD rescue regimen was used in patients with the CYP3A4*1B NN genotype.

Co-administration of pomalidomide with fluvoxamine (a CYP1A2 inhibitor) in the presence of ketoconazole approximately doubled the exposure of pomalidomide. Pomalidomide appears to have a low potential for clinically relevant DDI and is unlikely to affect clinical exposure of other drugs. It is recommended that the concomitant administration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors should be avoided unless medically necessary and the dose of pomalidomide be reduced by 50% when administered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors and strong CYP3A inhibitors",
