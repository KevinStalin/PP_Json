He was treated with hydroxychloroquine, antibiotics and oxygen and was discharged after five days. A week after the discharge, the patient developed excruciating pain in the left wrist and upper limb in the distribution of the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve followed shortly thereafter by hypoesthesia and dysesthesia in the same distribution. At onset, the pain was rated by the patient as 10/10 and was treated with acetaminophen with minimal relief. It gradually decreased and eventually resolved after two weeks. The patient noted no weakness and no other areas of pain or sensory symptoms. The neurological examination revealed normal strength, normal sensation except as noted, and normal reflexes. Electrodiagnostic testing performed five weeks after symptom onset showed a reduced sensory nerve action potential amplitude of the left lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve. No other abnormalities were detected on nerve conduction study (Table 1) . Needle electromyography of the This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

Ultrasound evaluations of the left median, ulnar, radial, posterior interosseus and musculocutaneous nerves were unremarkable along their explorable courses. A diagnosis of pure sensory neuralgic amyotrophy was made. Six weeks after the onset, hypoesthesia and dysesthesias persisted. Pure sensory involvement is a possible presentation of neuralgic amyotrophy. 4,5 Antecedent or concomitant infections are considered as possible triggers of an immune-mediated pathophysiologic mechanism. 6 Notably, in the present report diagnosis was delayed because the lockdown measures prevented a timely evaluation. The present report, which adds to the one described by Siepmann et al. 1 broadens the neurological spectrum of COVID-19 infection and suggests that this virus may be among those associated with neuralgic amyotrophy.
