This study examined the daily step counts of participants in the first national steps challenge. Six data points from 186,653 valid participants were retrieved and analyzed in five periods using Poisson regression. The mean daily steps peaked at 3196 in Period 1, and steadily dropped to 1205 in Period 5. The daily steps per period were analyzed using the participants' characteristics, such as the type of participant, sex, age, body mass index, and area of residence. The overall mean daily steps of the participants meant physical activity was far below the recommended level and tended to drop in later periods. The general population achieved significantly higher mean daily steps than public health officers or village health volunteers (24.0% by multivariate analysis). Participants who were female, younger (<45 years), obese (body mass index > 30), and living in rural areas had fewer mean daily steps (13.8%, 44.3%, 12.7%, and 14.7% by multivariate analysis, respectively), with statistical significance. In the future, the national steps challenge should be continuously implemented by counting all steps throughout a day, using more strategies to draw attention and raise motivation, advocating for more participants, as well as reporting the whole day step counts instead of distance.",

Increasing physical activity could prevent at least 3.2 million NCD-related mortalities per year, globally [2] .

To reduce selection bias by including the inactive participants in the analysis, we selected only \"active\" participants who sent data every time in those six datasets, the \"completer\" as shown in Figure 2 . We excluded participants aged below 18 years since children and adults had different physical activity recommendations [1] and the number of participants aged below 18 was very small (n = 1817, 0.004%). Participants aged above 80 years were also excluded to avoid a possibility that children had submitted data on their behalf [26, 27] . Although the program system set a maximum distance of 45 km per report and allowed four entries, we set a more realistic maximum distance of <45 km/day (approximately a full marathon a day) because anything more than this was considered unreasonably high (e.g., technology bug or false report) [13, 28] . Out of the total 392,565 registered participants in the server, only 186,653 participants with complete data were included in this study. The program was primarily aimed at public health personnel and village health volunteers (VHVs) aged 18-60 years, but was also open for others who were interested in the program.

Each dataset contained the cumulative distance in kilometers.",

To reduce selection bias by including the inactive participants in the analysis, we selected only \"active\" participants who sent data every time in those six datasets, the \"completer\" as shown in Figure 2 . We excluded participants aged below 18 years since children and adults had different physical activity recommendations [1] and the number of participants aged below 18 was very small (n = 1817, 0.004%). Participants aged above 80 years were also excluded to avoid a possibility that children had submitted data on their behalf [26, 27] . Although the program system set a maximum distance of 45 km per report and allowed four entries, we set a more realistic maximum distance of <45 km/day (approximately a full marathon a day) because anything more than this was considered unreasonably high (e.g., technology bug or false report) [13, 28] . Out of the total 392,565 registered participants in the server, only 186,653 participants with complete data were included in this study. ",

This might be explained by the fact that some participants might not carry their smartphone throughout the day [13] or only reported additional steps from their baseline [15] . Additionally, the decline in daily steps reflected behavioral decay of the participants. This might be due to the design of the awards that focused on competitive value more than positive reinforcement on everyday healthy behavior. For example, finishing T-shirts and medals for the first 5000 men and 5000 women who had achieved 60 km might discourage participants from continuing after achieving the program goal. Moreover, awards for provinces that had the most numbers of VHV registrations reflected a focus on registration numbers rather than ongoing participant engagement. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly disrupted domestic physical activity: the Thailand national physical activity survey in 2020 found a 55% decrease in adequate physical activity levels during March to May 2020 [35] , during the \"lock-down\" in responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand [36] . National curfew policies were implemented, including city lockdowns, stay-at-home measures, and the closure of public places, to reduce physical gathering (recreational parks, stadiums, gyms, and other sport venues [35, 37] . Thus, many participants could not reach the recommended benchmark. In the future, the program should be redesigned to include more challenging goals and promotional strategies, e.g., 10,000 steps per day, a loyalty or health points system that accumulates for tiers of rewards, and more incentives.",

However, even small amount of steps from only recreational activity were useful, according to a systematic review from Hall et al., suggesting that an additional 1000 steps per day can reduce all-cause mortality and the risk of cardiovascular disease [15] . Hence, in the future, national step challenge policy should take a comprehensive physical activity concept, including all steps occurring throughout the day (during household chores, occupational requirements, child care, errands, and transportation) [39] . This will also encourage persons who do not regularly engage in any sports or exercise events to increase their daily steps [30, 38] .",

However, this study finding was in line with a meta-analysis that reported that the effect of a pedometer use was moderate to high for older adults, relative to juveniles and young adults [12] . Innovative methods to promote physical activity in young adults, such as using a built-in smartphone accelerometer should be implemented. Other strategies, such as introducing a reward system or corporate challenge, might engage the interest of various population groups [10, 13, 14, 38] . Unsurprisingly, being obese was correlated with a smaller step count compared with non-obese persons, which might be explained by the fact that obesity impedes body movement and is associated with other chronic conditions. This finding was in line with the outcomes in prior literature [41, 42] . It suggests a lack of health-promotion design that suits at-risk participants (such as obese persons and women) [38] . A step-based intervention focusing on walking and running may not be suitable for obese persons compared with other low-impact activities (such as biking and swimming) [1, 45, 46] .",

The Thai Ministry of Public Health should continue this steps challenge policy, with some adjustments; for instance, counting all steps throughout a day [1, 46] , using other strategies to attract people's attention, and raising the motivation of various groups of participants [10, 13, 14, 38] , as well as networking with other agencies (such as the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labor, and civic groups) to reach a wider group of people [8, 16, 45] . In terms of program monitoring and evaluation, \"step\" and \"distance\" can be both monitored using smartphones, non-expensive smart wrist bands, or smart watches; also, the program should use \"step\" as unit of measurement rather than \"distance\", as it better reflects an adequate physical activity level and reduces errors from using the mean stride distance to convert distance to steps [7, 29, 30] . Moreover, the reporting system should upload the step data everyday with the use of the bib or registration numbers from the start of the program.",

            "text": "We found both strengths and limitations in this study. The strengths include the use of a countrywide database, which allowed us to assess the magnitude of the intervention outcomes via a great diversity of datasets. Secondly, this study had a large number (186,653) of participants, with valid reports across the country. Thirdly, controlling for several covariates, such as the type of participant, sex, age, BMI, and area of residence, helped minimize the bias in the estimated results, which might be due to confounders. However, the results of this population-based study should be interpreted with caution because some limitations still remain. First, the distance data used in the analysis were acquired from self-reporting, which might create a chance that the participants did not submit the data to the application every day or sent inaccurate distance data. Secondly, the equation that we used for converting distance to steps was based on the mean stride distance using male and female Korean adults [31] and male and female Chinese elderly [32] . Thus, it might not fully match Thai stride distance. Thirdly, the first available online dataset that was applicable for the analysis started from 21 February 2020 (the first date when the bib number was available). This means that the trend in daily steps before this date cannot be calculated due to a lack of a unique identifier. Fourthly, there was no baseline distance; therefore, the authors cannot determine if the intervention changed the distance or steps per day. Finally, there were other demographic data that were not included in the database, such as occupation, underlying diseases, and exact geographical residence, all of which might reveal other aspects of the data.",

The general population had significantly more mean daily steps than the public health officers or VHVs, overall and in each period. Females, younger participants, obese persons, and rural residents had significantly lower mean daily steps than their counterparts, overall and in each period. The Ministry of Public Health should continue this steps challenge policy with some adjustments to make the policy suitable to the lifestyle of diverse participants. These include counting all steps throughout a day, motivating various groups of participants, and advocating for more participants by networking with other stakeholders. Furthermore, the program should use \"step\" as unit of measurement rather than \"distance\", and the data should be uploaded and reported everyday with the unique identifier, made available since the first day of the program, in order to allow a trend analysis.",
