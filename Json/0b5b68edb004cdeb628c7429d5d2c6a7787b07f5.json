Transcriptomics data and genome sequence analysis facilitated phylogenetic analysis to address the COVID-19 pandemic during the first stages. By reading the abstracts and in some cases the methodology session, we identified the omics technology or the bioinformatic approach, and the overall purpose of the research. Genome and protein sequence analysis account for the 43.47% of the Scopus articles, from which 58.33% are focused on establishing SARS-CoV-2 taxonomy and determining the animal origin. (figure 4). Molecular docking was the third bioinformatic approach most explored by June 19th, 2020, focusing on the identification of potential antiviral drugs (figure 4). Transcriptomics and metagenomics approaches were the main omics source data to perform phylogenetic analysis in SARS-CoV-2. Once the taxonomic position was consistently established by different authors, the goal of using the aforementioned approaches was redirected to exploring the virus-host interaction, treatment options, virus detection, and pathogenesis.

Table 2 shows the top ten cited articles along with the number and the name of the journal, country, number of authors, affiliated institutions, the specific omics or bioinformatic approach used and the purpose of the study. China led the research with 8 of 10 articles, in co-authorship with Australia in 2 articles and 1 with Saudi Arabia and USA. The number of authors varied from 2 to 46, with a mean of 15.7 authors and of 3.4 affiliated institutions per article referent. As it has been pointed out from the above results, table 2 reaffirms that at the beginning of the pandemic, omics data and bioinformatic tools were mainly used to perform phylogenetic analysis to either taxonomically classify or identify the animal origin of the virus. Wu et al. (11), is the most cited article; published on February 3, 2020, in Nature, by 19 authors from 5 different institutions different from China and one in Australia, followed by Chan et al.

Three out of 62 articles are focused on researching the animal origin for SARS-CoV-2 through phylogenetics analysis from metagenomic data of animals viromes and SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences data (23-25).

Also, these authors suggest a possible role of Prevotella in the severity of COVID-19 by increasing severity of pneumonia. Bojkova et al. (27) on the other hand, used primary analysis of proteomics data to identified host cell pathways that are modulated by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can be useful, as the authors suggests, for developing J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f therapy options for COVID-19 by preventing viral replication in human cells. Robson (28), used protein sequences deposited in GenBank, and simulation tools to predict binding sites used by SARS-CoV-2. The author proposed a sialic acid glycan binding function for the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which can be potentially targeted for therapeutic agents to tackle SARS-CoV-2. This would be a different way of interaction between the virus and host cells other than the receptor ACE2.All studies approaching vaccine development were computational in spirit, and Robson has many publications regarding this matter (28-30). In one of his studies he found, through a Q-UEL language, that the sequence of amino acids KRSFIEDLLFNKV was particularly well conserved and corresponded to a region of the SARS virus that are believed to be required for virus activation for cell entry (30). According to the author, this sequence motif and surrounding variations can lay the foundation to outline a specific synthetic vaccine epitope and peptidomimetic agent. Regarding the development of antivirals, they were also mainly approached by in-silico analysis.Studies by Neogi et al. (31), Sepay et al. (32), Kumar et al. (33), among others, aimed to identify drugs or strategies against SARS-CoV-2, such as miRNAs in SARS-CoV-2 (34), the effect of Shengjiang San on SARS-CoV-2 (35), chromone derivatives as inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 (21), or even the use of chemical compounds from Indian spices as anti SARS-CoV-2 drugs (36). Phylogenetic analysis, as we mentioned before, were one if the main objectives of the studies included. Lam et al. (25), for instance, focused on identifying SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses in Malayan pangolins, finding multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV-2, which, according to the authors, suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible reservoirs in the emergence of new J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f coronaviruses and, hence, in order to prevent zoonotic transmission, they should be removed from wet markets. Other authors considered bat_SARS like coronaviruses, as phylogenetically closer to SARS-Cov-2. Therefore, there are some studies comparing structurally the genome and proteome of SARS-Cov-2 isolated from patients, against coronavirus sequences with bat origins (37-39). Rehman et al. (37), found that mutations in different genomic regions, but especially over the Spike gene, of this new virus, influence its reproductive adaptability, making it better in quickly adapting to the changing environments. Malik et al. (38), also support Rheman findings, by showing that in their genomic analysis, the S gene of SARS-Cov-2 was found to exhibit lower sequence identity with other Betacoronaviruses, which might me explaining their success to jump to the human host. Additionally, since the Spike protein interacts with the human receptor ACE2, these divergent features might be potentially altering functional effects on the interactions with the ACE2 receptor. Likewise, Srinivasan et al. (39) analysis converged to similar conclusions as to the above, adding an extra potential effect of the mutations in the Spike protein, relating to antibody binding sites that were used to inhibit infections with other coronaviruses.CONCLUSIONSBibliometric analysis and visualized mapping can help monitor research methodologies focused in omics or computational sciences regarding the SARS-CoV-2 recent outbreak. During the first 7 months of the pandemic, the researchers took advantage of stored sequence data to identify and taxonomically and molecularly characterize the etiological agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. This information was essential for the policy makers across the globe to take public measures to track and control the the virus. The trends in omics and bioinformatics approaches are now moving towards the study of host-virus interaction and characterization of pathogenesis from the perspective of system biology.",
