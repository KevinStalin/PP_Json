We find that the platform is more likely to provide a uniform (differential) pricing strategy with new products when the revenue sharing portion of the consignment contract is sufficiently low (high). Moreover, surprisingly, without blockchain, the platform prefers moderately perceived and true quality secondhand products, instead of extremely high or low quality. With blockchain, the platform prefers selling low-uniqueness and low-quality (or high-uniqueness and high-quality) secondhand products. Furthermore, we find that with blockchain, horizontal integration is more effective in improving the supply chain's total profit. A win-win-win outcome can be achieved for the platform, the supplier, and consumers in a supply chain that sells low-uniqueness products.",

Recently, many companies have developed a scalable protocol based on blockchain technology, which gives consumers access to trustworthily tracked product quality and supply chain information (Choi, 2019; Choi and Luo, 2019) . Based on a survey from the consulting firm Gartner, by 2023, at least 30% of manufacturing companies with products valued at USD5 billion will have implemented blockchain (Dimitrov, 2019) . Blockchain is now a unique solution for identifying the quality of secondhand products and effectively preventing the moral hazard problem in resales Of course, blockchain is not the sole solution to disclose product quality. The traditional technologies such as RFID can also provide quality disclosure. However, consumers may not fully trust it because RFID information can be revised by individuals, but blockchain cannot. Blockchain provides a trustworthy and unique \"certificate\" to show historical product quality information such as for how long the product has been used, who used it, and how it was used. Moreover, blockchain data cannot be modified or altered by an individual.",

            "text": "Secondhand products are now popularly traded and compete with new products. The global online retailer Amazon provides its consumers with an option of new versus used products. Selling secondhand products creates an ecosystem in the circular and sharing economy (Wen and Siqin, 2020) . A survey from the European marketing firm GMI indicates that about 70% of consumers have purchased secondhand products. In particular, women are more likely to buy secondhand books, clothes, accessories, jewelry, and shoes, whereas men are more likely to buy secondhand electronic products and cars (Chahal, 2013) . The major reasons to purchase secondhand products include 1) consumers are not willing to purchase or cannot afford new products, and 2) consumers are not able to get new products because of a short supply in the market. However, the quality of secondhand products might be uncertain for consumers, who cannot know the true quality of the products before buying. This uncertainty causes a long-existing moral hazard problem of buying secondhand products because sellers usually have more product quality information than buyers (Fernando et al., 2018) . For example, counterfeit products are prevalent in the luxury market, but most consumers cannot distinguish a counterfeit product from a genuine one in secondhand product consumption. Consumers are easily deceived by secondhand vehicle dealers \u2022 The platform decides the price of the secondhand products (Orlean, 2019) . Contributors mail and consign their secondhand products to the platform. As a product expert, the platform receives the product, evaluates it, and then decides the price.",

We consider a supply chain consisting of contributors, one online platform, and one supplier. The platform sells secondhand products. The supplier sells new products. The contributors consign their secondhand items to the platform and collect part of the revenue if the products are sold. In terms of the supply chain structure, we consider two scenarios: (1) the platform is independent and competing with the supplier, i.e., it is a decentralized supply chain; and (2) the platform is co-opetitive and horizontally integrated with the supplier, i.e., it is a centralized supply chain.",

RQ 3: What are the impacts of decentralization and horizontal integration on selling secondhand products? Our main contributions are as follows. First, our findings can contribute to the literature of pricing decisions in the sharing economy. We find that product uniqueness significantly influences pricing differentiation for both secondhand and new products. When selling low-uniqueness products, the platform offers a differential pricing strategy with new products, whereas when selling high-uniqueness products, the platform offers a uniform pricing strategy with new products. Moreover, we find that the revenue sharing portion between contributors and the platform in the consignment contract critically influences pricing strategies. A low revenue sharing portion drives the platform to provide a uniform pricing strategy, and a high revenue sharing portion drives the platform to provide a differential pricing strategy. Furthermore, in terms of quality preference, without blockchain, the platform prefers selling secondhand products that have moderate perceived and true product quality, instead of extremely high or low quality.",

They find that secondhand books are poor substitutes for new books for online consumers, and that the introduction of secondhand book selling can improve consumer surplus. Our paper also considers product substitution between secondhand products and new products in terms of quality difference. Choi et al. (2018) examine how the secondhand products can be collected efficiently in terms of collector types and retail competition. Mutha et al. (2019) consider a channel optimization problem in which secondhand products of various quality conditions are sold to third-party remanufacturers. They show that there are various structural properties of optimal assortment in terms of different quality levels in the supply chain. Feng et al. (2019) develop a twoperiod model to evaluate the optimal production and quality when products sold in the first period become secondhand products competing with new products in the second period. They find that the presence of secondhand products in the market decreases the total production quantity but improves the product quality. Esenduran et al. (2020) focus on the online resale channel of secondhand electronics. They find that contributors are very sensitive to price, timing of payment, and online ratings when selling secondhand products to an online platform. The prior literature did not examine quality information asymmetry towards the new and old products. In this paper, we evaluate the impacts of quality differences among the real quality of new products, the perceived quality B. Shen, et al. Transportation Research Part E 142 (2020) 102066 of secondhand products, and the real quality of secondhand products to consumers. Ryan et al. (2012) consider an online marketplace as an intermediary that matches buyers with sellers. They identify the optimal decisions for participation fees and revenue sharing contracts for both the retailer and the marketplace. Yan et al. (2018) study whether e-tailers and traditional retailers are willing to join the common marketplace to sell products. They find that a high platform fee is not an effective incentive for e-tailers to join the marketplace. Tian et al. (2018) examine the interaction of the marketplace and the reseller in e-commerce. They find that both the cost of order fulfillment and upstream competition intensity influence the optimal selection in terms of the marketplace, the reseller, and their hybrid. Xiao and Xu (2018) investigate how the online retailer can install the right level of capacity to extract the full surplus from the seller. They find that the lost-sale penalty contract can accomplish the above two goals but the commission contract cannot. Li et al. (2019a,b) study offensive pricing strategies for online platforms with message dissemination. Choi and He (2019) evaluate the impacts of rental services on fashion product operations on online platforms. They find that a revenue sharing contract is more effective than a fixed service charging scheme. Lin et al. (2019) examine product bundling strategies with competition on e-commerce platforms. Gong et al. (2019) study an online sharing economy system consisting of a powerful e-tailer and a budget-constraint seller. Du et al. (2019) examine a platform-led advertising problem in which two manufacturers are competing in the platform market. Liu et al. (2020) investigate how the market size and data-driven marketing influence the performance of online platforms in the supply chain. Cai et al. (2020) evaluate the effective contract design for platform supported supply chain operations. Wen and Siqin (2020) examine how product quality uncertainty affects the sharing economy platforms. They find that it is not always wise for the platform to improve product quality. In this paper, we are motivated by real practices in the sale of secondhand products and consider that product quality information is asymmetric for different supply chain members if blockchain is not adopted.",

Recently, a large number of studies have examined the impacts of blockchain technology on supply chains. Chod et al. (2019) document how blockchain can achieve transparency and financial benefits in supply chains. Wang et al. (2019) adopt a sensemaking theory to explore the benefits of blockchain on supply chains as perceived by industry experts. investigate the impact of blockchain technology on global supply chain risk analysis through the mean variance approach. Cui et al. (2019) compare the value of information transparency between parallel and serial supply chains. They find that the profit of both the supplier and the buyer can be improved in serial supply chains. Saberi et al. (2019) explore how supply chains use blockchain technology to realize sustainability for governance, the community, and consumers. Min (2018) argue that blockchain is also a peer-to-peer network of information technology to enhance supply chain resilience in terms of risk and uncertainty. Quality information asymmetry may cause risk and uncertainty for consumers' beliefs. In our paper, we follow the literature of the impacts of blockchain and evaluate the value of blockchain in terms of quality disclosure for secondhand products in an online marketplace. Blockchain is a technology wherein information is in a scalable protocol that can only be accessed by consumers who have permission (Choi, 2019; Choi and Luo, 2019) . Choi (2019) examines the use of blockchain to ensure diamond authentication and certification in supply chains. Choi and Luo (2019) study the value of blockchain for data quality improvement in sustainable fashion supply chains. Their results imply that blockchain technology is beneficial to social welfare but not to supply chain profit. Choi et al. (2020a) study a system consisting of two competing rental service platforms with product quality information disclosure on the blockchain. They find that platforms are more likely to implement blockchain for quality disclosure if the products have a higher profit margin. Moreover, they explore the value of using a consignment contract in the supply chain. This assumption is similar in our paper. However, in contrast, we consider the consignment contract between the platform and contributors in the sale of secondhand products.",

            "text": "In the actual practice of selling secondhand products, it is common for contributors to consign their products in the marketplace. Consignment contracts are similar to revenue sharing contracts in terms of the revenue sharing portion. Wang et al. (2004) examine supply chain channel performance under a consignment contract with revenue sharing. They consider the scenario in which the supplier decides the retail price and retains ownership of the goods. If the product is sold, a percentage of the selling price goes to the retailer. A consignment contract with revenue sharing is a common approach. In the scenario that we consider, although the online B. Shen, et al. Transportation Research Part E 142 (2020) 102066 platform does not own the product, it does determine the price. Buratto et al. (2019) study the value of consignment contracts for cooperative programs. Zhao et al. (2019) study a supply chain system in which two manufacturers sell through a retailer, using a consignment contract with revenue sharing. They find that the whole chain's profit can suffer from vertical integration under a consignment contract. in this paper, we consider horizontal integration in which the platform is horizontally integrated with the supplier of new products to sell products to consumers. Choi and Guo (2020) evaluate the zero-wholesale price contract with revenue sharing. Our proposed consignment contract is very close to Choi and Guo (2020) because, in our paper, the contributor owns the product but the seller does not under the consignment contract. Such a contract arrangement is also examined by Gong et al. (2019) in which the platform could take a predetermined share of the sales revenue if the product is successfully sold on the platform. It is popular to use consignment contracts for vendor-managed inventory (VMI) systems. Chen et al. (2010) examine how the consignment contract achieves channel coordination in VMI systems. They identify Pareto improvements among channel participants in a consignment contract that includes revenue sharing with side payments. Hu et al. (2014) use a consignment contract with consumer return policies to manage inventory control. They find that it is always beneficial for the supply chain to delegate the inventory decision to the vendor under a consignment contract. De Giovanni et al. (2019) examine a consignment contract with VMI. They find that revenue sharing is more effective than cost sharing in VMI. Bieniek (2019) studies the impact of consignment contract in VMI with stochastic customer demand. In our paper, our proposed system for the secondhand platform is similar to VMI because the contributor owns the product and the platform decides the price.",

The quality level of the new product is normalized to 1. The price of the accepted secondhand (old) products p o is determined by the platform, and the price of the new products p n is determined by the supplier. We consider that the price of secondhand products cannot be higher than that of new products, i.e., p p o n . This assumption is realistic for most products except for limited edition products.

Different from the decentralized SC, in the centralized SC, the increased revenue sharing portion no longer results in an adequate supply for the platform.

Proposition 5 reveals that when selling low-uniqueness secondhand products (Case A), both the platform and the supplier raise prices when the platform is horizontally integrated with the supplier. Because horizontal integration creates a co-opetitive business environment, and market competition is less intense so that both the prices of new and secondhand products can be increased.

The main difference is, if the blockchain operation cost is negligible, selling moderate quality products in the centralized SC with blockchain can hurt the SC's total profit. This result can be explained as follows. Quality disclosure of true highquality secondhand products can boost the platform's profit significantly, and as such, eventually enhances the whole SC's performance. However, a sufficiently low quality helps reduce competition and thus benefits the SC's performance. Consequently, if the true quality of the product is sufficiently high or low, implementing blockchain in a centralized SC is recommended. Table 3 summarizes the impacts of blockchain on the SC's profits. We observe that using blockchain always has a positive impact on the SC's profits for low-uniqueness and low-quality products, or high-uniqueness and high-quality products, but it hurts the SC's profits for low-uniqueness and moderate-quality products, or high-uniqueness and low-quality products. Thus, with the use of blockchain, the platform should sell low-uniqueness and low-quality (high-uniqueness and high-quality) secondhand products.",

This result provides important insights to supply chain managers who work for the platform and supplier when deciding the optimal product quality and uniqueness. Third, when selling low-uniqueness products, the platform can enjoy the benefit of the quality disclosure effect from using blockchain if the true quality of the secondhand products is sufficiently high or low, whereas the supplier can enjoy the benefits if the true quality of the secondhand products is sufficiently low. In other words, if the true quality of the secondhand products is sufficiently low, the use of blockchain can achieve a win-win outcome for the supplier and the platform through horizontal integration. Fourth, when selling high-uniqueness products, both the supplier and the platform achieve a win-win outcome without blockchain in the decentralized SC if the true quality of the secondhand products is sufficiently low.

Fig. 5 provides a clear picture of the value of blockchain with respect to total consumer welfare. First, from Fig. 5(a) , we see that for low-uniqueness products, no matter in a decentralized or centralized SC, blockchain can benefit consumer welfare when the true quality of the secondhand products is higher than the perceived quality. As we find in Proposition 3 that, with blockchain, both the platform and the supplier reduce prices when the secondhand product's true quality is high, it is natural that the consumer's welfare improves. Moreover, we see that when the true quality of the secondhand products is high, blockchain is more effective in improving consumer welfare in the decentralized SC than in the centralized SC. In the decentralized SC, information about the quality of the secondhand products is asymmetric. Thus, quality disclosure through blockchain is especially relevant for low-uniqueness and highquality products. However, for high-uniqueness products, disclosing the high quality of the secondhand products through blockchain hurts the total welfare in the decentralized SC. This implies that in short supply, the platform and the supplier raise the prices to match the high quality of product, and thus the consumer's welfare reduces.",

Shen, et al. Transportation Research Part E 142 (2020) i as the value of horizontal integration on the total welfare in the cases without and with blockchain, respectively. Fig. 6 shows that horizontal integration improves the SC's total welfare for low-uniqueness products, but hurts the total welfare for high-uniqueness products. This is because for low-uniqueness products, prices are important to consumers. However, for highuniqueness products, the degree of \"scarcity\" is crucial to consumers who will evaluate whether to purchase a new or old product. Hence, the price advantages brought by the horizontal integration can benefit the contributors of low-uniqueness products more significantly. In other words, in terms of the total welfare, horizontal integration is more valuable for the SC that sells low-uniqueness products. Combining these results from those of Proposition 7, we see that in the SC that sells low-uniqueness products by horizontal integration, the performance of the platform, the supplier, and consumers can be better off (comparing the cases when selling highuniqueness products or through the decentralized supply chain), i.e., a win-win-win outcome can be achieved for the platform, the supplier, and consumers.

It might be worthwhile for future research to evaluate how a platform could sell limited edition products to consumers while competing with the supplier.

Future research can explore the impacts of an endogenous revenue sharing portion on the platform's pricing decisions. Third, we do not consider the previous price of the secondhand products. Previous prices are important references (Wei et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019a,b) . Future research could investigate price references for secondhand products.

In future research, we will explore a two-period model that includes the implementation cost of blockchain. Fifth, the sales data of secondhand products can be used for demand information updating (Shen et al., 2019a . In future research, we can examine the value of information updating on supply chains with secondhand products. ), the secondhand platform is in short supply, hence consumers who fail to buy secondhand products will purchase the new one as long as his utility is non-negative. : by using backward induction, we take the first and second order derivatives of Table 4 Insights and managerial recommendations.",
