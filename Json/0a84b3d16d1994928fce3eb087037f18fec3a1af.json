According to the World Health Organization, as of September 12 th , 2020, more than 28 million COVID-19 cases have been reported worldwide, resulting in more than 0.9 million deaths. 1 COVID-19 causes acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in approximately 20% of hospitalised subjects with COVID-19. 2,3 ARDS has a high mortality rate (35-46%), particularly in subjects with a greater degree of lung injury. 4 As of May 15 th , 2020, 57% of the 4,855 UK hospitalised subjects with COVID-19 that required advanced respiratory support died. 5 Currently, the most effective treatment for COVID-19 is unknown, and management is largely supportive. One treatment recommended by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) COVID-19 subcommittee is prone positioning. 6 Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have shown that early prone positioning can improve the ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio) and reduce 28-day and 90-day mortality in severe ARDS. [7] [8] [9] Although initial prone positioning improves oxygenation in both non-intubated [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and intubated [15] [16] [17] patients with COVID-19, the physiological response to repeated prone positioning and its' association with length of stay and mortality for COVID-19 has not been reported.",

            "text": "We found that in COVID-19 subjects placed in prone positioning, oxygenation improved and better oxygenation responses were associated with overall better outcomes. This is the first report to our knowledge on changes in PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio after repeated prone positioning sessions and the associated outcomes of those changes. Although high mortality from severe COVID-19 has been reported, 5, 21-23 our 28 day ICU mortality was 21.4%, which is similar to the PROSEVA study. In PROSERVA, 62.4% of subjects had ARDS due to pneumonia, 6 while all of our subjects had virus-induced ARDS. The pre-prone positioning PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio in our study was higher than that in the PROSEVA study, possibly due to the higher level of PEEP we utilised. If the five subjects we placed on ECMO were grouped with those that died, to simulate the incidence of ECMO utilisation in Italy during the pandemic (1%), 24 our mortality rate (38.1%, 16/42) is still lower than reported mortality for intubated COVID-19 subjects with severe ARDS. 5, [21] [22] [23] Similar to the findings from other studies, 11-13,15-17 PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratios improved after the first prone positioning session in our study, as also reported by Meenen and colleagues. 25 Nevertheless, our study also showed that survivors responded to prone positioning on the second and third prone positioning cycles, in contrast to little or no response in those who ended up being placed on ECMO or those that died. Our findings suggest that the oxygenation response to prone positioning, after each cycle, may be helpful in guiding decisions regarding facility transfer or earlier escalation to ECMO. COVID-19 ARDS has been proposed to be an atypical form of ARDS in terms of recruitability. 26 Gattinoni et al indicated that intubated COVID-19 subjects whose respiratory system compliance was high [50.2 (14.3) ml/cmH 2 O] had lower recruitability, 27 which was J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f consistent with two other European reports. 17, 27 In our study, however, the respiratory system compliance was lower (median:29.2ml/cmH 2 O) than that reported by Gattinoni et al, 17, 27, 28 but similar to four other studies. 15, 16, 22, 29 Additionally, in subjects who responded to prone positioning (defined as PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratio improvement of \u2265 20%), we found no difference in preprone positioning respiratory system compliance when compared to non-respondents during the first three prone positioning sessions. The same result was found between the treatment success and treatment failure groups. It should be noted that body mass index was ~1.3 times larger in our study compared to body mass index in the European ARDS population reported by APRONET and others. 8, 28 This might explain low compliance found in our subjects. A trend of higher BMI was seen in the treatment success group, which may reflect the obesity survival paradox described in pneumonia. Future studies are needed to validate this finding in subjects with COVID-19. 30 In our study, we used ventilatory ratio to evaluate dead space. 29, 31 The pre-prone positioning ventilatory ratio in our subjects was higher than the subjects in a preceding study which used similar volume settings. 15 This might be explained by the higher acuity of subjects in our study, as evidenced by the need for higher PEEP, higher plateau pressures, lower compliance, and lower PaO 2 /F I O 2 ratios before initial prone positioning. After prone positioning, the ventilatory ratios were increased within 1 hour. This might be explained by alveolar overdistention caused by the same (pre-prone positioning) PEEP being applied during post-prone positioning. PEEP was reduced around 4 hours after prone positioning in our study, due to the improvement of oxygenation. It was also maintained at that level after supine position, and interestingly, ventilatory ratios returned to pre-prone positioning levels. This finding is J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f suggestive that close monitoring of changes in dead space and timely reduction in PEEP during prone positioning is needed, which might help to avoid alveolar over-distention.",
