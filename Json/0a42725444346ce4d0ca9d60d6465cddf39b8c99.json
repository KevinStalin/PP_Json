In this article, we develop a theoretical framework of policy implementation that combines collaboration from public and private sectors (\"Public-Private Partnership,\" or PPP) to efficiently deal with urgent crises such as COVID-19. We explain the role of new institutions prompted by policy failure precedence (Time 1) that at a later time period (Time 2) allow for the activation of PPPs with the aim to extend the political life of incumbent leaderships. Specifically, we examine the case of South Korea, a country in which a prior case of MERS in 2015 (Time 1) had established new policies for pandemic governance. In 2020, such policies were activated by the incumbent leadership in order to contain COVID-19 (Time 2). In particular, for swift and effective management of the pandemic, the South Korean government utilized partnerships with the private sector to exponentially increase the amount of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing. We apply Policy Feedback Theory to demonstrate the political effects of failed policy precedents and how the political outcomes again shape new policies in a dynamic and cyclical manner. Empirically, we conduct a content analysis of South Korea's pharmaceutical sector in government procurement and exports of test-kits during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that as the pandemic situation progressed, South Korea's leader, who had been in danger of plummeting support to the extent that impeachment was discussed as a viable option, drastically shifted public opinion to achieve a landslide victory in general elections in April 2020. Our findings suggest that democratic governments, aware of precedents and wary of their fate in elections, are pressured to perform well in crisis management, and thus turn to rapidly mobilizing public and private means for survival. Such means are evidenced by the case of emergency use authorization (EUA) process for test-kits, in which \"leapfrogging players\" -up-and-coming innovators -that contribute to turning a pandemic crisis into an opportunity for sustainable leadership and for themselves.",

The determinants of success were often explained through the lenses of bigger government and 'authoritarian residue,' 5 6 whereby South Korea was perceived to have citizens with relatively higher degrees of obedience who yield to government power due to the remnants of authoritarianism the country underwent in the 1970s and 1980s. The real reasons the system worked are quite different; moreover, checks and balances on the government by citizens were at the core of this success 7 and the model relied heavily on voluntary participation by South Korean citizens. 8 The interactions between public and government are evidenced by the institutions that 1 Fisher, Max and Choe Sang-Hun.

Detailed country-specific expertise is required to effectively explain this model for future application by other countries. Contextually, such a research task would be difficult to undertake without looking into the formulation of the policy process with a longer timeline of observation by comparing the current responses to with previous responses to precedence-that is, comparing the traumatic experience of the MERS in 2015 under an incompetent government with the present-and by a thorough examination of how the policy actually was activated and implemented. The MERS infection toll of 186 in South Korea was the highest of anywhere outside the Middle East, and resulted in 38 deaths. 11 In an attempt to better explain the South Korean model of its responses to COVID-19, this article examines in depth the South Korean government's political motivations underlying one significant aspect, testing. The technology for RT-PCR test-kits to test MERS-CoV had already been developed by leapfroggers of the South Korean IVD industry, but they were not readily available at private medical facilities and were only utilized by the KCDC during the MERS 9 Rogin, Josh.

Due to the unavailability of widespread testing sites during MERS, the long wait times of the test results from the KCDC, and the lack of information and transparency, impatient patients had gone to and from hospitals to be tested, causing cluster infections centered on hospitals.",

We apply policy feedback theory, which highlights how precedence (Time 1) reshapes policy and politics, followed by a subsequent crisis (Time 2), and how the new political environment created as a result 'feeds' back into the creation of future policies (Mettler and SoRelle 2014) . We present our theoretical framework built on policy feedback theory and the grounds for PPPs, whereby many private actors are leapfrogging South Korean players in innovation. 15 We test our theoretical framework by content analysis (Hsieh and Shannon 2005; Zaidman-Zait 2014; Erlingsson and Brysiewicz 2017) 16 of the PPP on assessing RT-PCR (a molecular technology that detects and extracts the gene of Coronavirus, which is a single-stranded RNA from a patient sample, then uses a reverse transcriptase process to synthesize cDNA, or complementary DNA, which is amplified to check whether the patient has been infected by the Coronavirus) test-kits from leapfrogging industry players (Fudenberg, Gilbert, Stiglitz and Tirole 1983) in the IVD field (whereby a molecular technology that analyzes key DNA, RNA, or protein biomarkers [analytes] is used to identify a disease, determine its course, evaluate response to therapy, or predict individual predisposition to a disease) (Debnath et al. 2010; Cheng et al. 2016) in South Korea. We concentrate on the South Korean health authorities' activation of EUA of the kits in a timely manner for an early response to COVID-19. We analyze data from \"Our World in Data,\" an open-source that provides up-to-date figures on COVID-19 by country, to compare South Korea's early response in testing that helped contain the coronavirus in the country.",

Compelled by the citizens and pressured by impeachment petitions, Moon's party pledged to elevate the KCDC from 'Center' to 'Office' if elected. This became their main focus for the general election, and to demonstrate that they actually meant it, they immediately gave way to the KCDC to serve more independently as a control tower on behalf of the president. 23 The early response to the pandemic that had been absent in Time 1 under Park was activated in Time 2 under Moon by enabling large-scale testing via EUA by the KCDC in consultation with the MFDS to procure massive amounts of RT-PCR test-kits from South Korea's pharmaceutical industry through PPP (a mechanism that is explained in the following section). To ensure transparency that it lacked and had been criticized for in Time 1, the KCDC would hold daily briefings on COVID-19 followed by Q&A sessions from the press to be televised and streamed online through Facebook and YouTube in Time 2 to deliver correct and updated information and to prevent misinformation. This indicates that, congruent to policy feedback theory, the outcomes and legacies of Park's policies in Time 1 compelled new institutional actions under Moon in Time 2, and shifted budgets and resources to interest groups that support efficient pandemic-battling (Pierson 1993) .",

This is becoming increasingly the case in a world in which the mutation of infectious viruses occurs at a rapid pace, without certainties on the delivery of a vaccine. For instance, in a rapidly unwinding pandemic situation such as COVID-19, in which expertise and knowledge are still being accumulated, government engagement with academic and private entities for the common goal of fighting infectious diseases-through funding for research and development, auditing, and assessing product quality assessment for immediate deployment-has become more or less inevitable ( ",

These industries promote an ecosystem that can support start-up companies that can grow and make business decisions independently from the government (Pacheco Pardo and Klingler-Vidra 2019). In connecting leapfroggers to PPP, the fundamental rationale for collaboration by various entities derives from the stark realization that one actor is not enough to accomplish the technology required in the future due to the speed of development and competition. Furthermore, as the post-developmental state in South Korea evolves, there are new industries that the extant big players do not have a niche strategy for, and cooperation can be a better option than mere mergers and acquisitions in this regard. On January 27, 2020 -only one week after Patient Zero -the Infectious Diseases Analytics Center at KCDC, the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine, and the leapfrogging RT-PCR test-kit producers of the IVD industry had a meeting. It was decided at the meeting that the leapfroggers were keen on an EUA for the RT-PCR test-kits 26 Dayton, Leigh.

Chaebols were not at the meeting-not even Samsung Biologics, as RT-PCR test-kit production is not their forte. The leapfrogging SMEs in IVD had been working only on RT-PCR technology for the past two decades while Samsung had been churning out chips and cellphones. Months later, Samsung became instrumental in constructing a smart factory system for RT-PCR test-kits by IVD leapfroggers Solgent, Kogenebiotech, and SD Biosensor, as well as masks for COVID-19-a system established with the initiative by the Ministry of SMEs and Startups. 28 As such, Samsung Electronics contributed to expediting the production process for mass production for the leapfroggers but did not provide the main RT-PCR technology.",

As early as January 30, the KCDC (inclusive of the National Incheon Airport Quarantine) as well as 18 other public health institutions nationwide announced extended testing service to private hospitals throughout the country on independently to public and private hospitals and treatment centers where large-scale testing is being conducted nationwide ( Figure 2 ). As of May 29, 2020, there are seven South Korean RT-PCR test-kit manufacturers that have passed the KCDC-MFDS vetting process ( Table 2) As seen in Table 2 , with the exception of BioSewoom, six out of seven \"leapfrogger\" companies that were issued EUAs as of May 29, 2020, were established from the year 2000 and onwards, which means that they are relatively young companies with strong research caliber, considering the growth period involving extensive R&D in the pharmaceutical industry. They are leapfroggers also in the sense that they are SMEs, as only Seegene and Biocore are sizeable companies listed on the Korea Exchange (KRX), with SolGent on course to be listed in 2021, whereby being listed for trading shares on the KOSDAQ market requires company capital of 30 billion Korean won. 56 The PPP process provided them with the opportunity to showcase their quality and prospects in the biopharmaceutical sector. Among them, six out of the seven companies have been issued EUA by the United States by the USFDA as of July 31, 2020, through a vetting process that South Korean manufacturers of test-kits had also applied for in the U.S. in tandem with the domestic process by the KCDC and MFDS (Table 3) . 60 Kim, Ji-eun.

In the wake of COVID-19, 62 Public opinion polls reveal caution and unease toward Moon's drive and willingness to strengthen inter-Korean cooperation through family reunions, the establishment of inter-Korean liaison offices in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, and railroad connections. In a 2018 poll conducted by Hankook Research, 36% of participants responded that the national economy will worsen if aid is given to North Korea in full scale, with just 27% responding that the national economy will improve. Regarding the impact of aid to North Korea on the domestic economy, 27% answered that it would worsen the domestic economy while only 10% said aid would improve it (Jeong 2018) . These views represent the controversy and public concern that Moon's unilateral aid to North Korea will negatively impact national security and the economy.

In addition, the president at the time of SARS (Rho Moo Hyun) was generally considered to have done an effective job in containing SARS (there were no domestic deaths and only 3 infected from SARS) and ideologically closer to Moon than Park, so less was to be noted from the SARS case in terms of the possible political downturn following failure in pandemic governance compared to Park's governance of MERS (Yeom 2020 MERS, and forest fires in Gangwon-province. \"Now, we want to go one step further and increase the national disaster management system and response capabilities to deal with large-scale complex disasters that occur in series.

Namely, the administration witnessed the negligence of the Park Geun-hye administration toward MERS and the political backlash in 2016 which contributed to impeachment in 2017. 17 This lesson is evidenced by our analysis of Moon's official speeches, emphasizing MERS as a distinct past which South Korea has learned and evolved from.",

The IDPCA was revised and updated multiple times to reflect immediate challenges. The revisions right after the MERS outbreak took place on July 6, 2015; December 2, 2016; March 27, 2018; and December 3, 2019. The revisions on these dates are the institutional changes that took place after MERS (Time 1).

The agreement was signed by 187 states including South Korea 21 at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan, on March 18, 2015. 22 Thereafter, scholarship on disaster risks advocated for joint collaborative PPP in disaster risk management, with the development of management mechanisms along with clearly defined roles and responsibilities of actors involved and responsible business conduct (Eyerkaufer, Lima and Gon\u00e7alves 2016). The impeachment of Park Geun-hye based on the charges of corruption and mismanagement of national disasters underlines her failures in many policy realms including MERS (Hahm and Heo 2018). Thereafter, a political standard was set in South Korea by the public that does not allow political leaders to survive without demonstrating competency in crisis management. Park's negligence in acting swiftly and preemptively against MERS, among other incidents of perceived incompetence, formed views about what constitutes effective policies on both elite and public levels (Ku, Lee, and Woo 2017). Frustration among the public regarding her performance in governance and inaction eventually led to a series of candlelight vigils and explosive demands for Park to step down, from December 2016 until impeachment, March 2017, and the call for transparency and integrity institutions were made in this process (Shin and Moon, 2017; Turner, Kwon and O'Donnell 2018).

The role of PPPs in strengthening health systems has now come into the limelight not only in the developed world(Taylor & Christian, 2016;Parker et al. 2019) but also in the developing world(Shrivastava et al. 2016).The institutional changes that allowed for nationwide RT-PCR testing beyond the KCDC for testing in private medical facilities through the EUA under the IDPCA in tandem with augmented transparency in policy implementation was key to South Korea's early response to COVID-19. Policy feedback theory must be complemented with PPP and leapfrogging in orderto best explain the South Korean early response in that a) policy feedback theory does not explicate the details of change nor guarantee success in Time 2, and b) PPP and leapfrogging fill in the detailed contents of pandemic governance -the forms of governance, in the context of policy feedback theory, through which the South Korean case can be fully explained. In sum, reflecting upon the South Korean case requires a closer examination of how PPP was effectively utilized in Time 2 as a feedback to policy failure in Time 1. In South Korea, PPP in Time 2 effectively utilized upcoming and leapfrogging pharmaceutical companies, many of which were small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in innovation (elaborated further in the following section). The pathways of PPP development and implementation are crucial in understanding the South Korean case of pandemic governance of COVID-19, in evidencing how it can actually work, while simultaneously catapulting pharmaceutical SMEs for their research caliber and global marketability of products in countries where applicable.",

On the documentation of South Korea's responses to MERS, we relied on past government documents of the Special Committee Activity Report onResponses to MERS   (2015)  and the verbatim record from their meetings, as well as documentation from the South Korean epidemiological experts on MERS (i.e., White Paper on MERS) and provincial government records. We also relied on previous South Korean media reports of the Park administration on MERS. We depended largely on South Korean government sources on the EUA process through press releases by the KCDC and the KFDA. We closely monitored the briefings of the KCDC on COVID-19 beginning January 28, 2020, which air every weekday at 2:10PM supplemented by Sunday briefings by the MOHW at 5:00PM Korea Standard Time based on the daily briefing documents issued, via the KTV YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/chKTV520) and KTV Facebook Live, as well as the intermittent briefings by the MFDS on masks provision via the same channel. We also relied in part on the Special Committee on the Responses to COVID-19 established in February 2020.The basic tenets of policy feedback theory highlight how both the public and leaders can learn from the political effects of past policies to design new ones. For the EUA on South Korean testkits from the U.S. for nationwide use, we depended on the EUA process and data from the USFDA, the test-kits supply data from MOHW, and export data from South Korean Customsand the Ministry of Finance and Economy. We utilize \"Our World in Data\" of the Global Change Data Lab for figures on daily testing per population in South Korea. We add assessments of policy based on political performance after pandemic governance in Time 1 and Time 2, based on poll ratings from Gallup Korea. Weekly public opinion polls that assess the Korean public's evaluations of the president's governance as either positive or negative, as well as the respondents' reasons for such evaluations, were analyzed from just before the outbreak of pandemics and throughout their duration. These span both former South Korean President Park Geun-hye's support rates during the time MERS hit South Korea in 2015, as well as current President Moon Jae-in's policies to battle COVID-19 in 2020. We also provide a policy assessment of political performance in Time 1 and Time 2. Data visualization of the change in public support shows that, congruent with the tenets of policy feedback theory, the political consequences of policy feedback (as either success or failure) reshaped the ensuing political environment. While the public's disappointment in Park's failing to contain MERS was a contributing factor to Park's impeachment and removal from power, the public's perception of the effectiveness of Moon's COVID-19 policies impacted the success of Moon's political party in the general elections that followed on April 15, 2020. Finally, for further evidence that Park's failure to efficiently contain MERS in South Korea was a contributing factor to impeachment, and that Moon did indeed face the political consequences of Park's (mis)management of MERS in dealing with COVID-19, we analyze primary sources on the South Korean Constitutional Court's decision for impeachment and Moon's official speeches, respectively. Moon's speeches range from the first outbreak of COVID-19 on January 30 to May 8, 2020, which is the most recent date the government released Moon'changes have been made since the time of MERS and during the time of COVID-19. Most importantly, extant legal foundations of the IDPCA were amended. Revisions of the IDPCA 39 were made in 2015, and additional amendments were made in 2020 for more effective and stronger quarantine. 40 41 The legal changes paved the way to allow conditional use of personal data to activate the Smart Management System developed by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport (MOLIT). 42 More importantly, what enabled an early response and the creation of a nationwide large-scale testing environment was the amendment of the enforcement decree of the IDPCA, passed via a fast-track process in the National Assembly on February 26 coming into effect beginning March 3, 2020.

The Impact of Policy Responses to Pandemics on Public Opinion and Political Survival by Incumbents 1) Political Performance in Time 1 and Time 2Analysis of public evaluations of former president Park throughout the MERS outbreak and President Moon during the COVID-19 pandemic presents a number of indicators on how public support is affected by leaders' responses to pandemic situations: 1) policy neglect, or failure to swiftly and actively react to contain a pandemic, leads to a large drop in public support, and, conversely, 2) assertive policy action against a pandemic can cause a spike in public support. It can be assumed that the South Korean people's disappointment regarding Park's ineffective action to protect them from MERS raised public concern for safety and anxiety, eventuallyplaying a role among other factors in Park's removal from power. On the other hand, the skyrocketing positive evaluations of Moon's policy response to COVID-19 in 2020 and his subsequent high support rating most likely contributed directly to the landslide victory of Moon's party in the general elections in April. This section observes trends of the political consequences of disaster management by analyzing the rise and fall of public support for Park's and Moon's leadership during the MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks, respectively. Gallup Korea conducts weekly public opinion polls to assess the public's perception of the current president's governance as either positive or negative, as well as their main reasons for such evaluation. The survey questions used for this can be translated as: 1) \"Would you evaluate the president as doing well or badly?\" and 2) \"What is the reason you think the president is doing well / badly?\" (open response). The patterns of positive or negative evaluations of the president are visualized below in Figure 7 and Figure 8.2) Park: Pandemic Governance Disappointment Affects Political DownturnAbove many markers of effective governance such as the economy, the South Korean public views protection of people's lives and public health as a critical policy priority.Figure 2shows the change of public support for Park during the MERS outbreak in 2015.",

In the 1 st week of June, as MERS broke out, positive assessments of Park take a nosedive from 46% to 38%. After this drop, even at the final stages of MERS Park's positive evaluations do not recover to above 40% again. Throughout the period of late May to late August, when MERS was most salient in Korea, Park's response to MERS was noted several times as the foremost reason for negative evaluations. In no week was MERS ever stated as a reason for positive evaluations of Park. MERS first appeared in the polls as a reason for negative evaluations of Park in the 1 st week of June, at 14%. The following week is when MERS started appearing as the main reason for the public's negative appraisals of Park, with 27% of respondents pointing to Park's lack of action to battle MERS as the most important cause in their negative evaluations. It can be judged that the public viewed Park's MERS policies as most problematic, considering the second reason respondents gave most for negative evaluations (\"No communication / not open to the public / not transparent\") was only mentioned by 13%, or less than half of those who pointed to MERS.",

One month into activation of the PPP and the EUA, South Korea succeeds in flattening the curve. Additionally, RT-PCR test-kit developers respond to subsequent KCDC calls for EUA. Those with EUA granted find themselves in excess supply after the curve has been flattened; together with those yet without EUAs that are granted approval for exports, they begin to export the RT-PCR test-kits abroad via Korean Air flights that transitioned suspended passenger airplanes due to COVID-19 into cargo planes, gaining global recognition. 34 35 Positive responses on the test-kits from abroad gain international recognition for the South Korean IVD sector, with continuous requests for orders from some 101 countries, compelling the government to set up a task-force solely for test-kits export. 36 Public opinion is swayed based on the performance in pandemic governance.

Um Joong-shik of the Korean Society for Healthcare-associated Infection Control and Prevention has also been quoted as saying that the U.S. and Europe can no longer provide a standard for South Korea -and that thus far no country other than South Korea has been able to conduct 25,000 RT-PCR tests per day, ensuring the capacity of such testing in South Korea.

With soaring demands for South Korean RT-PCR test-kits from abroad, in order to facilitate the ordering process by foreign buyers, the MOHW compiled a list of manufacturers authorized for exports with details of products and links to respective company websites for contact. The list has been uploaded on the Korea Health Industry Development Institute website. 58 Noting the time sensitivity of the RT-PCR test-kits, the Korea Customs has streamlined and simplified the export process of these test-kits and the import of required test-kit ingredients from abroad. 59 The Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency (KOTRA) helps expedite the process from receiving deliveries 57 Press Release, ' Public-private joint venture opened a road for exports: Korea International Trade Association -Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy transport 34 tons of emergency air cargo to China and Indonesia using idle airliners,' (translated), Korea International Trade Association, April 29, 2020. https://www.kita.net/asocGuidance/nesDta/nesDtaDetail.do?pageIndex=1&sNo=9144 58 'List of COVID-19 IN Vitro Diagnostics Device,' Ministry of Health and Welfare, April 1, 2020. https://www.khidi.or.kr/board/view?pageNum=1&rowCnt=20&no1=9999999997&linkId=48825484&refMenuId= MENU01499&menuId=MENU01498&maxIndex=00488257649998&minIndex=00488175749998&schType=0&sc hText=&schStartDate=&schEndDate=&boardStyle=&categoryId=&continent=&country=59  Oh, Sang-hun and Woo-young Choi.
