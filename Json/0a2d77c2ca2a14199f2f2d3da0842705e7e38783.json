Restrictions enacted in Australia included school shutdowns and the closure of non-essential businesses, while the majority of outpatient health appointments were conducted by telehealth. These restrictions successfully flattened the curve with the expected surge of COVID-19 cases and uncontrolled community spread not seen in Australia during the time period described in this study. However, concern has emerged that, with fewer presentations to general practitioners and emergency departments 4 , other serious health concerns may have gone undiagnosed.",

DKA is an avoidable complication if symptoms and signs of diabetes mellitus are recognized early 6 . DKA places increased burden on the healthcare system and may require intensive care support in tertiary care settings for management. Additionally the presence of DKA at diagnosis has been associated with poor long-term glycaemic control 7 . During a pandemic, it is important to minimize avoidable admissions to intensive care units when resources may be limited. Emerging research during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown an increase in children with type 1 diabetes presenting with DKA in countries such as Italy 8 and the USA 9 . A recent study of the German population found the frequency of severe DKA was significantly higher during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that children under the age of 6 years were at the highest risk 10 .",

The reason for this is unclear. This was not attributable to COVID-19 infection in the individuals. However, we hypothesize that presentations with new-onset type 1 diabetes may have been delayed as a result of concern regarding COVID-19 and the restrictions put in place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic period, people were advised to minimize contact with others. Children had less contact with people outside of their primary household, with online learning rather than face-to-face schooling, a reduction in contact with friends and family and an increase in virtual medical appointments. Unemployment rates rose and many workers had to adapt to working from home. Disruption to everyday routine could easily have led to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes being missed. Additionally, the media showed images of people lined up outside hospitals to be tested for COVID-19 and overseas infection rates and deaths were widely reported. It is possible that people felt that going to their doctor or the emergency department would have placed them at risk of contracting COVID-19. This is supported by the fact that emergency department presentations to the John Hunter Children's Hospital fell during this time period.",

Interventions aimed at raising community awareness of the signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes have been shown to reduce the frequency of DKA at diagnosis 13, 14 . During a pandemic where schools are in shutdown and many primary care consultations occur via telehealth, alternative ways of raising awareness need to be considered. It is vital that in the eventuality of a subsequent wave of COVID-19, strategies are implemented in order to avoid a similar increase in severe DKA. These could include social media campaigns, traditional media advertising, mailouts or advertising in local primary health services.",

Although this study reports the experience of a single centre, the John Hunter Children's Hospital Diabetes Centre provides care for all children with type 1 diabetes over the large geographic region of Newcastle and the Greater Hunter. Our experience during the period of pandemic restrictions was anomalous in comparison with the preceding 5 years at our centre. The results reported in this study are likely to be representative of other Australian tertiary centres, most of which have experienced some degree of lockdown. Performing similar studies in centres with differing case rates of COVID-19 and severity of restrictions enacted would help determine if our experience is universal. Limitations of this study include the small sample size, which precludes stratified analyses and increases the chance of type II errors. This study is hypothesis-generating; additional studies that evaluate the reasons for delayed presentations of type 1 diabetes could be used to target campaigns more effectively to reduce this delay.",
