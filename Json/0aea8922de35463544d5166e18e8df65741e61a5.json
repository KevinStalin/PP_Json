Also, information and misinformation about such factors as those associated with the transmission of the virus, period of incubation, and impact on the socio-economic, political and psychological livelihood of people in the society put the general population at risk of mental health distress. In Nigeria, there is no empirical finding (to the best knowledge of the investigators) establishing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the general populace. However, several studies especially in Asia and Europe (Bao et al., 2020; Brooks et al., 2020; Kang et al., 2020; Shigemura et al., 2020) have reported serious psychological distress experiences of members of the society in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The effect is far-reaching beyond a specific geographical location as the political and socio-economic structure of the whole world is disrupted and crashing, thus putting people more at risk of experiencing psychological distress (Raviola et al., 2020) . It has also been argued that in periods of disease outbreaks, anxiety in the community can rise after the first death of a patient is being reported, also misinformation from media and increasing number of new cases can predispose people to serious psychopathology . Kang et al. (Kang et al., 2020) also opined that the present COVID-19 pandemic will drastically increase global stress and mental health burden.",

Recent studies affirm the high and huge level of psychosocial consequences of outbreaks like COVID-19 on individuals, the general public, and the international community (Hall et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2020) . For instance, in the period of SARS outbreak, many that were examined on the psychological consequence showed substantial psychological complications that were found to be related with young people and exacerbated blaming of self (Sim et al., 2010) , while those older people who were females and highly schooled, displayed higher anxiety feelings for SARS positivity, while the less educated had a moderate anxiety rate; those with known contact history with the infected individuals, perceived they have symptoms of SARS and have more tendency to indulge in preventive measures against the disease (Leung, 2003) .",

Specifically, the loneliness effect of reduced social interactions is a risk factor for several psychological disorders such as; anxiety, drug use, insomnia, major depression, and suicidal ideation especially among vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with health challenges. According to Rubin et al. (Rubin & Wessely, 2020) , excessive quarantine tends to give rise to anxiety significantly, for multiple reasons; even the elevated anxiety may also trigger and initiate the implications for some related mental health issues. Barbisch et al. (Barbisch et al., 2015) had earlier pointed out the implication of confinement on the psychological well-being of the public, by identifying hysteria, rejection and dejection feelings, obsessive-compulsive symptoms and mood challenges as conditions that can lead to complicated health issues in the victims and the public.",

This intervention has been found to be effective in treating disorders such as; anxiety, depression, suicide attempts, trauma-related problems, insomnia, etc in the face of a pandemic that strains health care resources (Augenstein, 2020; National Quality Forum, 2017) . Especially when face-to-face appointments are risky. 2. Federal and state governments should initiate a bill honoring the telemental health services to manage present and future pandemic psychological implications. 3. Healthcare stakeholders needed to collaborate with psychotherapists in the management of pandemic or disease outbreak to regulate residents' emotions and promote people's psychological wellbeing in society. 4. Experts should start an awareness campaign on basic means of overcoming psychological distress on media and in communities generally in Nigeria to foster mental healthiness. ",
