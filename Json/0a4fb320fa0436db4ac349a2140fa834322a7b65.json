Particularly, we are interested to investigate the economic perspective of COVID-19. This paper uses data from online published articles and current media sources, as the COVID-19 situation is unfolding yet. To deeply explore the said matter, we divide the economic impact into six dimensions that is, Chinese economy, Central Asian economies, South Asian economies, South East and West Asian economies, European economies, Northern African, and Middle Eastern economies. The paper concludes that epidemic situations like COVID-19 severely affect economies around the globe. The basic reasons behind such severity are immobility of labor, reduction in productivity, discontinuation of the supply chain, a decline in exports, uncertainty, and so on. This study is quite important for businesses and policymakers to estimate and plan current and post-COVID-19 situations.",

This horrible story was started from the market in which animals and birds are sold. The initial host of the virus was bat which also contains other viruses of the same family such as Ebola, AIDS, and rabies. But bats were not the only animals sold in Wuhan. However, it is of thought that maybe it would have infected other animals and birds too (Augustine, 2020) . The first cases were reported on December 31, 2019. Most of the death reported in the Hubei province of China in which Wuhan is located (Baker, Bendix, & Frias, 2020) .",
