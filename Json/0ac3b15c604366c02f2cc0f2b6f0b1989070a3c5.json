SARS-CoV-2 is found to have similarity with SARS-CoV, which showed conformational changes upon varying pH. There is no study till date on how pH change affect the conformtional flexibilty of SARS-CoV-2 M pro , therefore, we attempt to find the effect of pH variation through constant pH molecular dynamics simulation studies. Protein is found to be most stable at neutral pH and as pH turns basic protein structure becomes most destabilized. Acidic pH also tends to change the structural properties of M pro . Our study provides evidence that the flexibility of M pro is pH dependent like SARS-CoV M pro .",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a severe respiratory illness caused due to novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). 1 Coronaviruses belong to Nidovirales family, these are enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses, having very long genome around 30000 bases. 2 10 kilobases are used for structure and accessory functions and 20 kilobases encode for non-structural proteins. 2 The replicase gene encodes for the two overlapping polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, which are critical for replication and transcription. These polyproteins are processed extensively by virus proteinases and the functional proteins are released for carrying out the virus replication. 3 M pro also referred as 3CL pro , is a 33 kDa cysteine protease responsible for cleaving and processing of viral polyproteins. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 M pro free enzyme is recently solved by Zhou et al 4 at pH 7. M pro is a homodimeric protein, shown in Fig. 1 . Structure of each monomer is comprised of three do-mains. Residues 10-99, 100-182 and 198-303 are involved in the formation of domains 1,2 and 3, respectively. Dimerization of M pro is regulated by domain 3. Catalytic dyad of the enzyme is formed by residues His 41 and Cys145. Dimerization is necessary for the catalytic activity of M pro . 5,6 Due to its role in viral transcription and replication, M pro serves as an attractive target for drug designing. Many studies have been carried out to identify the potential inhibitors of M pro . 7, 8 Function of a protein is closely related to its structure. As structure perturbs from native conformation, its activity changes and under drastic conditions protein may become functionally inactive. Various extraneous conditions like heat, concentration of like and unlike molecules around and pH of surrounding etc affect the protein structure, therefore, their effects are important to be examined on the protein of interest. Proteins are composed of various amino acids having acidic, basic, aliphatic, polar and non-polar side chains. As pH of the surroundings is changed, the protonation states of these side chains also modify which in turn alters several interactions and give protein a distinct structure. Effect of pH was seen on the structure of SARS-CoV M pro by Jinzhi et al., 9 their study showed that the conformational flexibility of M pro is pH dependent. Henedersen et al. 10 utilized constant pH MD simulations to assess the proton coupled dynamics of various PLpros including SARS-CoV-2. In our knowledge, there is no pH dependant study of SARS-CoV-2 M pro structure has been conducted, therefore, in our study, we have seen the effect of pH alteration, ranging from acidic to basic pH, on the structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) through constant pH molecular dynamics simulations (CpHMD).",

Initial structure of protein was obtained from RCSB (PDB: 6y2e 4 ) and protein was solvated using TIP3P 15 water molecules inside trucated octahedron box of 18 nm. Charges on the protein were neutralized by adding counter ions. Energy minimization was carried out using 1000 steps of steepest descent followed by 4000 steps of conjugate gradient method, keeping backbone atoms restrained. Temperature of the system was slowly increased from 10 K to 300 K over 400 ps under NVT ensemble, followed by equilibration at constant pressure for 4 ns. Berendsen barostat 16 was used for maintaining constant pressure condition. The study utilized periodic boundary conditions and PME summation 17 for electrostatic calculations.The shake methodology 18 was applied to restrict covalently bonded hydrogen atoms. Time step of 2 femtosecond with 8 A 0 cut off for non-bonded interactions were applied. Convergence of energy, temperature and density were monitored. Parallel to the molecular dynamics simulation, the constant pH method applied in pmemd through Monte Carlo sampling of the Boltzmann distribution of individual protonation states. Distribution of protonation states is influenced by solvent pH, which is set as an external parameter. A total of five CpHMD simulations were run at pH 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, by varying the solvent pH. All the acidic aminoacids (ASP and GLU) are assumed to be deprotonated and basic aminoacids (ARG, LYS and CYS) to be protonated in this pH range. Protonation states of catalytic HIS 41 and CYS 145 were unchanged, all other twelve histidines present in the protein were set as titrable residues and their protonation states are subjected to change by changing the partial charges on the atoms of titrable residues. Production run was carried out for 100 ns, during production after every 100 steps protonation state change of every titrable residue was attempted. GB salt concentration was set to 0.1 M.",

For a better understanding, probability distribution curve of each RMSD value was constructed, (Fig. 2(b) ), two peaks were observed around 1.8 A 0 , 2.3 A 0 at pH 4 and around 2.4 A 0 , 2.9 A 0 at pH 8.

            "text": "Our study has demonstrated that structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ) shows pH dependence. At basic pH (pH 8), the structure of M pro was found to be least stable and as pH becomes more acidic, structure of M pro gets destabilized.The structure of M pro showed maximum stability at neutral pH. At all the pH other than neutral pH, dimerization and S1 binding pocket were found to be affected. Our study throws light on how an environmental factor like pH can affect the integrity of active site of M pro and encourage researchers to explore the small molecules that can modulate the intracellular pH to prevent the replication by lowering the activity of M pro .",
