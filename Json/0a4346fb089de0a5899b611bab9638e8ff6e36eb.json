Approximately 6.1% of Covid-19 cases were classified as critical-defined as respiratory failure, shock, and multiple organ dysfunction or failure (1) . Among the critically ill Covid-19 patients, \u223c6-47% of them were intubated in China (2-7), 71-75% were intubated in the United States (8, 9) , and 88% were intubated in Italy (10) . The sheer volume of patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation support entails that anesthesia professionals have been put under significant pressure during this pandemic. This pressure is exacerbated by the fact that many urgent and emergent surgeries must proceed, even in situations in which patients have confirmed or suspected Covid-19. Clearly, anesthesia providers are playing a fundamental role in the frontline efforts to fight against this formidable pandemic. This paper discusses the impact Covid-19 is having on contemporary anesthesia practice through different phases and highlights some of the lessons we can learn to inform future practice (Figure 1 ).",

While the reduction in the volume of surgical procedures being performed varies across different hospitals, it can be as high as 70-90%. This move suddenly relieves most anesthesia providers from perioperative care, with only a small portion being deployed to provide anesthesia for urgent or emergent surgeries.

These issues are related to self-protection, best practices of intubation and ventilation, and professional liability in delivering care to patients outside any specialist scope of practice. In mid-March 2020, an article was published documenting the intubation and ventilation experiences in one of the epicenters-Wuhan, China (11) . In this paper, the authors described the personal protective equipment (PPE) used by the Chinese healthcare workers. Of note, when performing invasive procedures in Covid-19 patients, including intubation and ventilation, all healthcare workers in China were required to follow Level III protective measures. Put simply, this mandates coverage of the entire body (11) . This practice has caused a wide-range discussion outside China. In comparison, in the United States, standard protective practice does not involve covering the neck or leg below the knee. Although we agree that neither under-protection nor over-protection are warranted, the most ideal approach to self-protection is unclear. We hope this information will come to light with future analyses of worldwide practice data.",

Many medical practitioners are scrambling to identify methods of sterilizing and reusing N95 masks and/or making their own face shields. Reports of doctors and nurses using unconventional selfprotection innovations, such as transparent plastic bags to cover the head and neck, have flooded social media and newspapers. The shortage of PPE and the difference in the availability of self-protection resources across different hospitals, regions, and countries have caused concern and confusion, and this has even resulted in some providers refraining from attending work (12) .

When delivering ventilatory support, most providers adhere to the following processes. They should avoid non-invasive ventilation, including continuous positive airway pressure and bilevel positive airway pressure, if there are enough ventilators and manpower for invasive mechanical ventilation. This is supported by reports from Lombardy region, Italy, where 11% of cases received noninvasive ventilation and 88% invasive mechanical ventilation during the first 24 h of ICU admission;(10) and in California, United States, 4% of ICU cases received high-flow nasal cannula, 1% non-invasive ventilation, and 91% invasive mechanical ventilation (17) . They should adopt lung-protective ventilation strategies; set an ideal oxygenation goal; deliver early prone position ventilation; ensure adequate sedation and analgesia; and provide muscle relaxation when needed (11, 18) . Lastly, the best approach to extubation is equally important as it may generate infectious aerosols as a result of patient coughing, and agitation (11).",

However, it is prudent to open the operating rooms more gradually for several reasons. First, the infection risk is lower but still lingers. Infection control requires time and energy and consumes resources. The need to ensure adequate protection and maintain control over the virus should be treated as a higher priority than maximizing caseload, given the potential for severe unintended consequences. Second, perioperative personnel, including anesthesia providers, have relearned and redesigned their approach to patient care to emphasize caution over throughput. Short of a vaccine that abolishes the future risk of Covid-19, there cannot be an immediate return to business as usual. Practitioners likely cannot achieve the necessary level of caution from an infection prevention standpoint, while achieving high throughput surgical volume, without neglecting other aspects of patient care and safety. Third, as we have learned now, some critically ill patients will continue to occupy the ICU beds, even weeks into the transition phase. Therefore, if a surgical case would typically require ICU admission after surgery, there will be a need to coordinate resource management with the hospital bed flow management team. Finally, the spread of the disease (hopefully through community spread and not at-work exposure/infection) will reduce the available workforce unpredictably. Contact tracing and temporary quarantine further reduce the numbers of available workers.",

False negative rates are non-zero but poorly defined (2-29% estimated based on current data June 2020) (21) . The preoperative preparation during the transition phase requires standardized approaches and policies. At a minimum, anesthesia providers need to be cautious during preoperative patient preparation. It is prudent to do the following: (1) wear a surgical mask and eye protection (goggles or face shield) when visiting, interviewing, and examining patients; (2) wash hands before and after each visit; (3) wear gloves when touching and examining patients; (4) consider avoiding chest auscultation if not clinically indicated; (4) be vigilant for the signs of infection; (5) follow up on pertinent labs; (6) follow up on chest x-ray or computed tomography results if ordered; (7) always remember to screen the patient for a history of Covid-19 and/or close contact with confirmed cases; and (8) consider testing for Covid-19 and the presence of an antibody response. Moreover, data regarding the protection provided by an immune response to prior Covid-19 infection and the duration of immunity are desperately needed.",

If a Covid-19 patient is undergoing surgery, the following recommendations are advised: 1) perform the surgery in a dedicated Covid-19 negative-pressure operating room; (2) follow the consensus PPE guidelines during intubation and ventilation; (3) ensure smooth emergence and extubation; (4) use filters that are capable of preventing virus transmission/contamination to the anesthesia machine; (5) try to use disposable supplies when possible; and (6) thoroughly clean/sterilize any non-disposable equipment after surgery.",

Different viruses have different behaviors, virulence, and modes of transmission; therefore, preparedness to adjust the approach to self-protection when confronting a novel virus and a new outbreak will be needed. A related issue concerns the adequacy of PPE supplies. Regular stockpile checking needs to be mandated. Methods of sterilizing and reusing different components of PPE need to be investigated and established. The supply chain needs to be bolstered, with contacts regularly maintained.

Bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation support was popularly used in the epicenter in Wuhan, China (11) . Continuous positive airway pressure ventilation support has been used in the United Kingdom (25) . However, noninvasive ventilation support has not been widely recommended for use in both Italy and the United States (10, 17) .

It is plausible to quickly teach practitioners immediately before and during the required activities; however, it would be better if the potential need in any future situation similar to this Covid-19 pandemic is anticipated and our providers are proactively trained so that they possess the skills they may need in an emergency situation. The good news is that the skills required outside the perioperative environment (e.g., ventilatory support) are not something unfamiliar to anesthesia providers, as critical care training is a component of anesthesiology residency in most countries.

Preparedness may use certain resources and cause financial concern, especially when a crisis is not observed for many years. Therefore, it would be wise to use the process of preparedness to promote a higher quality of patient care, education, research, and culture building.
