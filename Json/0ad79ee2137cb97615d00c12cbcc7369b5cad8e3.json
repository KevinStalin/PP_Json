Major sporting events and cultural activities have been canceled, businesses have suffered and closed, the use of public transportation has dramatically decreased, classes have been suspended, and the death toll continues to mount. The implementation of unprecedentedly strict quarantine measures in China has kept a large number of people in isolation (Qiu et al., 2020) , and all citizens have been asked to stay at home and go out less.

The outbreak of COVID-19 can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe. In contrast to common life stressors, the COVID-19 epidemic represents an acute, large-scale, and uncontrollable stressor. Generally, psychosocial responses to such stressors are varied and include feelings of anxiety, shame, personal and social failure, or weakness (Verghese, 2004) ; underestimation of the possibility of survival; overestimation of the likelihood of infection (Koh et al., 2005) ; excessive and inappropriate preventive measures; and increased demand for healthcare services in a time of shortage (Rosling and Rosling, 2003) . The results of a national survey showed that 98.54% of respondents felt excessive fear, worry, and nervousness, believing that the epidemic posed a serious threat . Another study pointed out that almost 35% of the general population reported experiencing psychological distress due to the COVID-19 epidemic (Qiu et al., 2020) . In addition, an internet-based survey found that public anxiety and panic were relatively high, and \u223c32.4% of the respondents were assessed as having depressive symptoms (Cai et al., 2020 ).",

Chinese college students have been exposed to a significant number of COVID-19-related stressful events during the outbreak, including disruptions to their academic, leisure, family, and social life. These disruptions have been shown to frequently cause boredom, frustration, anxiety, fear, and a sense of isolation from the rest of the world (Brooks et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2020) , leading to distress among college students.",

The National Health Commission of China has published several guideline documents to better address psychological problems in the Chinese population during the COVID-19 epidemic period. The rapid transmission of the virus between people impedes traditional face-to-face psychological interventions. Therefore, because of their safety, convenience, timeliness, and efficiency, online psychological counseling services have been widely established to provide free 24 h service on all days of the week for those in need (Liu et al., 2020; Zhao and Fan, 2020) . The state and various social institutions provide a wealth of psychological service resources, but we do not know the degree to which college students use these resources. Previous studies have found that when individuals encounter psychological problems, they show a tendency to care for themselves first and then for others (Jiang and Xia, 2006) . Professional psychological counseling or mental health services are not fully utilized by college students (Liang et al., 2017) .",

Possible solutions exist in each stage of the help-seeking process, and turning to professionals is considered at the end of the third stage. College students with poor mental health will turn to professional institutions and personnel for help only when all previous solutions are ineffective, showing a negative attitude toward help-seeking (Zhang et al., 2015) . Research has suggested that convenience, economy, recipient self-efficacy, perception of the nature and severity of the problem, social tolerance of problem behavior, help-seeking behavior, previous help-seeking experience, and other determinants may be the main factors affecting the decision-making process, but there is a lack of relevant research evidence, and a large number of hypotheses still need to be tested (Jiang and Xia, 2006) . However, during the COVID-19 epidemic, what is the utilization rate of mental health services among college students? What are the differences in mental health status between college students who use these service resources for psychological help and those who do not? What are the influencing factors? The answers are unknown and need to be studied. Therefore, by comparing the degree of psychological distress between college students who did and did not engage in psychological help-seeking, this study intends to determine the factors influencing college students' help-seeking behavior.",

We had prepared a normative notice applicable to these 85 schools, including the purpose, significance, deadline, and mode of participation of the survey. A contact person from each college was responsible for sending the above notice to each student via WeChat or QQ. Participants could use WeChat to access the survey and answer the online questionnaire anonymously by scanning the two-dimensional barcode or clicking on the relevant link from February 13 to February 22, 2020. An online consent form would be displayed on the front page of the online questionnaire; if participants had no objection to the objectives of the survey, they could officially start the survey by clicking the \"next\" button below, or they had the right to withdraw from the survey by closing the survey homepage. Each participant was only allowed to answer the questionnaire once. The whole process was entirely voluntary and non-commercial. In addition, all researchers involved in the survey had signed confidentiality agreements. Two sub-samples were formed according to the answer to the question \"Have you ever sought psychological assistance in response to the COVID-19 epidemic situation?\" and matched for age, sex, and grade.

First, during the COVID-19 outbreak, although college students faced many stressors, the rate of seeking psychological help was still low. Compared with those in the non-counseling group, college students who had sought psychological help experienced fear, trauma, and depressive symptoms more frequently. Second, the scores of fear, depression, and trauma during the COVID-19 epidemic can effectively predict the psychological help-seeking behavior of college students, and fear is the best predictor among them. Third, the experience with seeking psychological help and self-perceived mental health are also key variables for predicting the psychological help-seeking behavior of college students. College students who have experience with seeking psychological help and who perceive their mental health status as average or poor are more likely to seek psychological counseling during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

This finding confirmed that college students are indeed a risk group for underutilization of mental health services, and they often hold a relatively negative attitude toward psychological counseling, consistent with previous studies (Jiang and Wang, 2003; Hunt and Eisenberg, 2010; Liang et al., 2017) . In the face of psychological distress, college students often adopt informal ways to cope by seeking help from friends and family and seldom turn to professional psychological resources (Zhang et al., 2014) . Many reasons have been proposed to explain why they do not seek professional help for common psychological distress. These include psychological factors such as negative attitudes toward seeking help, stigma, coping style, self-efficacy, personality, avoidance, passivity, worry about the evaluation of others, lack of understanding, unrealistic expectations of psychological counseling, and practical factors such as cost, transportation, or inconvenience (Zhou et al., 2010; Gulliver et al., 2010; Tan, 2012) .",

            "text": "Psychological counseling was regarded as an imperative or last-resort choice by college students with poor mental health, and it was the final \"exit\" strategy adopted only when other channels for seeking help were blocked (Zhang et al., 2015) . Seeking psychological help is an effective coping strategy, whereas not resorting to professional counseling even if suffering from serious mental issues is an evasive coping strategy. This type of help-seeking or coping strategy is consistent with the characteristics of collectivist cultures (including traditional Chinese culture). Avoidant coping, one of the major coping strategies in traditional Chinese culture, is positively related to Chinese young adults' psychological symptoms (Tao et al., 2000) and is generally associated with greater psychological distress (Compas et al., 2001) . However, Gan et al. (2004) found that avoidant coping may be more adaptive than active coping when facing uncontrollable stressors such as SARS-related stressors because when individuals engage in avoidant coping, they tend to ignore or avoid the source of stress and thus leave the situation unchanged so as to reduce the emotional stress elicited by a problematic situation. Moreover, stigma can also prevent college students from seeking psychological help. Many college students who are plagued by mental illness try their best to hide their illness when the explicit symptoms are not obvious, fearing that they will be labeled with a stigma once they ask for psychological help. Studies have shown that mental illness stigma (Fang, 2015) and self-stigma (Zhang and Hao, 2019) can lead to negative help-seeking attitudes, interfere with individuals' choice of health-oriented actions, and hinder psychological helpseeking behavior.",

Psychological problems and emotional troubles are often expressed in the form of symptoms. A psychological symptom is a type of abnormal feeling state, and it is also the main manifestation of mental illness. When an individual regards his/her psychological problems as a manifestation of mental illness, he/she may have a positive attitude toward psychological help; otherwise, he/she may ignore the problem or try to solve it on his/her own. After all, most symptoms are transient and mild and do not constitute a diagnosis of the disease, and only meaningful symptoms can lead to health-oriented actions. Those who have suffered psychological pain but avoid counseling may, to some extent, define the psychological pain suffered during the COVID-19 epidemic as temporary, static, and a non-disease that can be alleviated with the control of the epidemic. This low perceived need would prompt them toward self-regulation rather than seeking psychological help (Jorm, 2012) . On the other hand, the finding that the college students in the counseling group scored higher in fear, trauma, and depression could also be explained by the health belief model. Generally speaking, the stronger and more persistent the psychological problems or painful symptoms are and the greater the impact on the individual's study, work, and life is, the easier it is to attract the attention of the parties concerned, which may lead to psychological helpseeking behavior (Liang et al., 2002) . This is because when psychological distress is identified as a symptom, the perception of susceptibility and severity becomes clearer, which increases the likelihood of behavioral change (i.e., seeking professional psychological help).",

            "text": "However, fear is not only a common known response to infectious disease outbreaks but also a stress response to public health emergencies. Based upon transactional theory (Lazarus and Folkman, 1984) , stress is described as an interactive process between stressors and an individual's psychological responses (e.g., appraisal, coping, adjustment). When confronted with a stressful situation, the body initiates the \"fight or flight response, \" and over time, the body may become exhausted, leading to physical and psychological burnout (Melamed et al., 2006) . Several studies have pointed out many problems caused by fear during infectious outbreaks, including accelerated disease transmission (Shultz et al., 2016) , economic downturn (Lempel et al., 2009) , a decline in immune function (Segerstrom et al., 1998) and mental health (Silver et al., 2013) , and delays in making help-seeking decisions (Ren et al., 2020) . Although fear causes many problems, it also motivates individuals to seek help and cope and thereby drives the contemporary mental health system (Lester, 2003) . To deal with stress at its root and restore psychological energy, individuals need to try to do positive things to reduce stress and engage in active coping. Calling a psychological hotline is a primary way for individuals to solve psychological problems during the COVID-19 epidemic. Using such a hotline can help individuals by increasing their psychological motivation, enhancing their psychological strength, stimulating their initiative and autonomy, building their confidence in their ability to overcome their own problems, and helping them to gain a sense of control and certainty (Duan, 2007) . For college students who were tortured by fear during the COVID-19 epidemic and were seeking ways to avoid being overwhelmed by the psychological exhaustion caused by the accumulation of pressure and problems, turning to psychological counseling was a concrete manifestation of active coping.",

(2016) found that the level of perception of psychological problems can positively predict the level of seeking professional help. The self-rating of perceived mental health has been shown to be stable from ages 23-33 and to be related to psychological distress (Mano et al., 2001) . The health belief model and the PDM jointly emphasize the importance of individuals' perception and judgment of their psychological problems, which is often the first step in the help-seeking process. As an extension of health belief theory, protection motivation theory emphasizes the moderating effect of cognitive processes between attitude and behavioral changes, including threat assessment and coping evaluation, which together form protective motivation and then promote the occurrence or maintenance of behavior. The selfperception of mental health is one of the important factors in the process of threat assessment. The perception of poor mental health status by an individual will initiate threat assessment and promote protective motivation, achieving behavioral change (i.e., seeking psychological help).",

            "text": "In terms of psychological help-seeking experience, those who have sought psychological help showed a more positive attitude and a stronger desire for help from psychologists. This is mainly related to these individuals' sense of self-efficacy and the expected benefits of psychological counseling. According to previous research in the field of professional psychological help-seeking, efficacy is mainly divided into two categories: individual self-efficacy in dealing with psychological distress and self-efficacy as a client of psychological counseling. Zhao (2008) reported that the lower an individual's self-efficacy is for dealing with psychological problems, the higher the willingness to seek help, because the person feels that it is necessary to turn to others to solve the problem. On the other hand, selfefficacy as a client of psychological counseling is positively correlated with professional psychological help-seeking attitudes. If individuals think that they can benefit from counseling, then their help-seeking attitude will be more positive (Liu, 2012) , and their willingness to seek help will be stronger (Wang and Sun, 2008) ; this consequently results in a higher likelihood of choosing to seek psychological counseling (Xia and Jiang, 2007) . In addition, it is typical to consider the expected benefits (the possible benefits of asking for help) before making a decision to ask for help. From the perspective of motivation theory, when an actor engages in a behavior, the target object of the behavior should be an inducement to the actor, and to a certain extent, the target object should be able to meet the needs of the actor and bring benefits to the actor. It is impossible for actors to pursue goals that are disadvantageous to them (Zhang, 1999) . Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that a good psychological help-seeking experience can increase college students' sense of self-efficacy and fulfill their need to resolve their psychological problems, which increases their probability of seeking psychological counseling in the future.",

First, the cross-sectional design could not explain the cause-effect relationships and does not allow the investigation of changes in individuals' mental health status and psychological help-seeking behavior across different periods of the COVID-19 epidemic, which could more fully reflect the psychological status and psychological helpseeking behavior characteristics of college students during the outbreak. Second, because all the constructs were assessed by selfreport, the estimated relations among fear, depression, trauma, and psychological help-seeking behaviors might be subject to response bias. Future research should adopt multi-informant and multimethod assessment approaches. Third, due to the use of the convenience sampling method, the study sample primarily comprised college students in Guangdong Province. Future research needs to expand the scope of the survey to other provinces and cities in China and carry out stratified sampling to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation of Chinese college students. Fourth, this survey lacked the measurement of the three processes of seeking psychological help, namely, help-seeking attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, limiting the explanatory power of the results. Future research can supplement the measurement of these key indicators, to better show the change in the psychological help-seeking process in the context of the epidemic.",

Fear caused by the COVID-19 outbreak is more likely to predict college students' psychological help-seeking behavior than depression and trauma because it not only causes a stress response but also strengthens college students' motivation to seek help. In addition, college students with good psychological help-seeking experience and poor mental health status have a higher probability of seeking psychological help, which may be related to self-efficacy and expected benefits.",

As students who were not directly affected by COVID-19 reported significant numbers of COVID-19related psychological symptoms during the epidemic, university campuses should develop and implement effective screening procedures to closely monitor students' exposure to stressors and mental health status. Moreover, fear is the key factor motivating college students to seek psychological help. We should design a psychological intervention program for fear and fully utilize psychological assistance hotlines to help college students better adjust themselves. Last but not least, performing psychological help-seeking intervention, strengthening the dissemination of mental health knowledge, and improving the level of mental health perception are effective ways to improve help-seeing attitudes and increase the probability that college students will seek psychological help.",
