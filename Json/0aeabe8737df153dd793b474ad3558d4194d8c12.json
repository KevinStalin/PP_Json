Many economic activities have had to be suspended or reduced and the pressure to reopen schools has been quite substantial. More information is required for policymakers and the general public to make informed decisions and to avoid potential civil unrest. The competition for developing a vaccine is intense, with about 321 vaccine candidates with 32 clinical trials currently in progress [1] . Besides the safety concerns [2, 3] the additional economic cost for the purchase and deployment of vaccines has not been factored into the substantial burden of the disease. To date, three vaccines have ended phase III trials and appear to show promising efficacy: Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford.",

The first proposes that, with few exceptions, it is almost impossible to stop this pandemic by mitigation and control measures, and that the most that can be done is to reduce the infection rate (at a huge economic and social cost), which is commonly referred to as flattening the curve. These measures may be implemented effectively for some time, but it is extremely difficult to maintain due to the enormous social and economic costs. The second establishes that there are now several reliable estimates of the IFR available, from different studies. It is the confluence of these two facts that permits us to establish a surrogate for the progression of the epidemic in a region and calculate the share of susceptible available, which can be used as the basis to reopen activities and deploy vaccines.",

This is particularly true for a disease where the number of asymptomatic individuals is by far larger than that the number of symptomatic, making it difficult to control.

Some attempts have been made to estimate IFR which would be a remarkable surrogate to measure the progress of epidemics in an arbitrarily defined region or population. However, the main drawback is that although the number of deaths from SARS-CoV-2 can be approximated, the total number of infected from the disease is elusive, especially considering that a large fraction of individuals that are infected are asymptomatic. Besides, the efficacy of immunity tests to detect who has been infected and recovered has been challenged with the findings that the ability to detect antibodies is reduced in a few days, especially in those with mild or no symptoms [12, 13] . Recently, Eyre et al. [14] reported that a high fraction of individuals with none or mild symptoms may be undiagnosed mainly due to the calibration strategies of some standardized tests and concluded that samples from individuals with mild/asymptomatic infection should be included in SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay evaluations.",

Since a fraction IFR of these infected die, herd immunity occurs when the fraction of deaths equals IFR(1 \u2212 1/R 0 ). Using a conservative estimate of R 0 = 5 and IFR = 2.5 per thousand infected, we conclude herd immunity occurs when the share of infected is 80%, that is, when the number of deaths equals 2 individuals per thousand.

This contradicts our findings that for an IFR as high as 2.5 per thousand the percentage of infected should already be close to 75% (see Fig. 3 ). Nevertheless, the fraction of people with antibodies is not a good surrogate of the fraction of infected individuals with SARS-CoV-2 because it underestimates the number of infected for two reasons: first, antibody testing is voluntary and it is natural to expect individuals with no symptoms to be less compelled to get tested than those who are symptomatic, resulting in a large percentage of infected not being tested, and second, some failures in testing have been reported, apparently .

            "text": "Everything leads to the following question: what will be the purpose of a vaccine in a region where the number of deaths per thousand is already large enough to suggest there is only a small fraction of susceptible with limited chance of infection? This question is especially valid from the comprehensive study in Iceland that strongly suggests the existence of immunity due to infection [15] . Unless it is proven that immunity wanes beyond a protective level after some time, everything seems to indicate that those regions where the share of estimated susceptible is already low should have less priority in the distribution of vaccines. If these considerations are not taken into account, a vaccination campaign in a region where the proportion of deaths among the population is close to 2 will just give the impression of being effective but will not play a significant role, regardless of the efficacy of the vaccine.",
