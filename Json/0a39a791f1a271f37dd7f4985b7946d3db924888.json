Therefore, there is a significant unmet medical need for a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19. Inflammation is the driving force behind coronavirus infections, and the majority of deaths caused by COVID-19 are the result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is crucial to control the inflammation as early as possible. To date, numerous studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) products, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and their derivatives (eg, exosomes) for coronavirus infections, which could be applied for the COVID-19. In this review, first, the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic in the present and future of TERM research and products are briefly presented. Then, the recent clinical trials and the therapeutic benefits of MSCs in coronavirus-induced ARDS are critically reviewed. Last, the recent advances in the field of tissue engineering relevant to the coronavirus infections, including three-dimensional platforms to study the disease progression and test the effects of antiviral agents are described.",

In this paper, the impact of the recent pandemic on the present and future of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine research and therapies is highlighted. Then, the potential use of three-dimensional tissue models and benefits and risks of mesenchymal stem cell therapy for the COVID-19 are discussed. (BM)-MSCs in aged H5N1-infected immunocompetent mice reduced the viral-associated acute lung injury and increased the survival rate. 8 Li et al evaluated the effect of systemically administrated mouse BM-MSCs (1 \u00d7 10 5 cells) in the treatment of H9N2 AIV-induced infection. 9 The administration of MSCs reduced the cytokine storm and contributed to reduced H9N2 AIV-induced acute lung injury and improved survival rate. 9 showed that a single infusion of up to 10 million cells/kg PBW was well tolerated and no infusion-associated events or MSCs treatmentrelated adverse events were reported. 16 In the weeks after infusion, serious adverse events were noticed in three patients. One patient died on day 9, one patient died on day 31, and one patient was discovered to have multiple embolic infarcts of the brain, kidneys, and spleen, but thought to have occurred before the MSC administration based on MRI results. The authors concluded these severe adverse events were not related to MSCs treatment. 16 In a double-blind, multicenter, randomized phase 2a safety trial, 40 patients with moderate to severe ARDS were treated with BM-MSCs (10 \u00d7 10 6 /kg PBW) and compared with the placebo group (n = 20) (NCT02097641). 21 The patients were treated within 7 days of ARDS diagnosis. The 28-day mortality rate was not significantly different between the MSCtreated group (30%) and the placebo group (15%). The BM-MSCs treated group had numerically higher mean scores for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III than the placebo group. 21 Still, the sample size in this trial was too small to reliably assess the efficacy of MSCs therapy in ARDS and larger trials are needed.",

This could be explained by the fact that chloroquine may exert its therapeutic effects via mechanism(s) other than contributing to blocking the virus entry. 32 Remdesivir (also known as GS-5734) is an adenosine analog prodrug with excellent potency against severe acute respiratory syndrome and the Middle East respiratory syndrome in human airway epithelial (HAE) cell models. 34, 47 Previous studies showed remdesivir might be a promising candidate for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 due to its ability to inhibit viral RNA replication. 48 In another study, human octamer-binding transcription factor 4+ (Oct-4+) progenitor cells and MSCs were grown on a collagen type Ibased matrix in a serum-free media. 49 The authors reported progenitor cells were able to differentiate into alveolar pneumocytes type I and II expressing ACE2. The results displayed that the Oct-4+ progenitor cells, but not the surrounding mesenchymal cells, were susceptible targets for SARS-CoV-1 and allowed virus replication. 49 This suggests an important potential role for Oct-4+ progenitor cells, which normally develop into the cilia in the bronchi and are mainly responsible for expressing ACE2, in the continued destruction of alveoli and loss of the lung capacity for regeneration after SARS-CoV infection. 49 Despite significant advances, a major drawback of current 3D lung models is the lack of human stromal, hematopoietic, and immune systems, as the critical components in the viral infection and pathogenesis. Therefore, future 3D models should investigate the safety and efficacy of antiviral agents in the presence of human immune and hematopoietic systems.",

The sustained release of inflammatory signals and adjuvants from the scaffold modulated the immune cell function and provoked adaptive immune responses. 54 This system has been applied to tumor vaccines in animal models with promising results, 52 64 Particularly when looking at concentrating many liters of cell solution, this must be done promptly (<5 hours) to not compromise cell viability and the functionality of the final product. 64 Volume reduction and filtration steps using appropriate systems at the scale that is required will need to be evaluated accordingly. Most standard laboratory centrifugation systems will not be able to handle large volumes >5 to 10 L. 56 In the separation step, the choice of the enzyme, the time of exposure, and efficiency of each step are critical in ensuring optimal cell survival.

As of 10 June 2020, over 7 400 000 confirmed cases and over 410 000 deaths have been reported worldwide, and numerous businesses are being impacted by COVID-19. The healthcare communities and industries have been largely impacted by this pandemic. In this paper, the impact of the recent pandemic on the present and future of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine (TERM) research and therapies is highlighted. Then, the potential use of three-dimensional (3D) tissue models and benefits and risks of Majority of non-COVID-19 clinical trials are disrupted and future funding grants for non-COVID-19 projects have been reassigned or opened up to COVID-19 only projects TERM filed applies engineering and life science principles to develop methods to regrow, repair, or replace the damaged or diseased cells, tissues, or organs. 1-3 TERM is a relatively new field and is just starting to be the most fascinating approach to develop new therapeutics at the dawn of the 21st century. Over the past few months, many scientists have been asked to stop their research. Many researchers have reported delays and disruptions to their clinical research. Hospitals have temporarily canceled their non-urgent operations and clinical trials, to focus their precious resources on COVID-19. The tissue replacement and reconstructive surgeries are among the most canceled operation, including knee, hip replacement, as well as shoulder, ligament, and breast reconstruction. Indeed, the biggest recent advances in reconstructive surgeries over the past years are the result of TERM techniques, as these strategies have the potential to augment conventional treatment options in reconstructive surgeries. Just a few months after the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical research staff running research in the areas of TERM are being made unavailable, and the recruitment of new participants to non-COVID-19 clinical trials are suspended, or significantly diminished. Meanwhile, many of the pharmaceutical and biotech companies have shifted their focus on the development of drugs and vaccines to treat people infected with this highly infective virus. It is expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will have strong and yet possibly unexpected consequences and impact on the future funding of TERM research activities.",

However, a greater body of research is required to fully evaluate the potential of MSCs therapy for COVID-19 induced ARDS.3.2 | The potential use of stem cell derivatives for ARDS treatment Apart from MSCs, their derivatives including exosomes have gained significant attention as a therapeutic strategy to achieve the therapeutic effects of MSCs without the risks and challenges of administering the cells to the patients.26,27 Exosome-based therapy is an emerging field of biomedical research and the therapeutic effects of stem cells have been attributed to the secreted exosomes.28,29 Specifically, the potential use of exosomes to ameliorate ARDS in preclinical models is well-documented.27 To date (June 13, 2020), 174 clinical trials have been registered to utilize exosomes within a range of therapeutic applications (Clinicaltrials.gov). However, there are no FDA-approved exosome products available on the market yet and each product requires an individual IND for each trial. Previous studies mainly administered exosomes by direct injection into the injured tissues or by intravenous injection, but inhalation could be the most direct and less invasive route of delivery to treat COVID-19 induced ARDS. Recently, Dinh et al reported the lung spheroid cell-secretome (soluble proteins, and extracellular vesicles) and exosomes delivered by inhalation could resolve the bleomycinand silica-induced lung fibrosis by reestablishing the normal alveolar structure. 28 A new registered trial (NCT04276987) aims to investigate the safety and efficiency of aerosol inhalation of allogeneic adipose tissue-derived MSCs' exosomes in the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Another trial aims to test the safety and efficacy of exosomes derived from allogenic T cells following targeted delivery by metered-dose inhaler in 60 participants (NCT04389385). Future clinical trials using exosomes and the conditioned media produced from MSCs might be an effective therapeutic for coronavirus-induced ARDS. 303.3 | The alternative sources of stem cellsIn the field of cell therapy for ADRS, a challenge is to identify appropriate cell populations that are able to modulate alveolar stem cell function and regulate the hyperinflammation caused by a cytokine storm.

Besides, warnings about social distancing, to stop the spread of a new coronavirus, are resulting in a significant drop in the tissue supply, specifically blood donation. In March 2020, the American Red Cross declared a severe blood shortage in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Also, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many blood donation centers are closed around the world. 6 To date, there are no reports on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the allogeneic blood transfusion, and future studies will clarify the risks of the transfusion-transmitted virus. 6 Also, the cells and tissues that have been donated and stored in tissue banks since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak may already have been infected with this virus and have to be checked for the presence of 2019-nCoV. Therefore, COVID-19 testing has to be added to the already extensive list of infectious agents. Yet, 2019-nCoV robust screening does not exist and there is an urgent need to develop a reliable test to screen samples upon harvesting for this highly infectious virus.

Typical expansions achieved in spinner flasks can range from 90 to 170 M cells/L. One group reported achieving 270 M cells in a 3L single-use spinner-flask bioreactor over 5 days. 61 Rafiq et al reported that they can achieve 850 M in a 5-L stirred-tank bioreactor over 12 days. 62 An alternative to traditional spinner flasks is suspension bioreactors like the PBS vertical-wheel bioreactor. Kalra et al reported the expansion of adipose-derived MSCs in PBS mini 0.5 L bioreactors in the range of 76 M to 100 M cells. Based on current observations, microcarrier-based cultivation of hMSCs in suspension bioreactors could generate 50 to 200 000 cells/mL. Paired with a highly robust hMSCs stock and high-performance expansion media systems, Kirian et al have reported achieving cell densities of greater than 0.5 M cells/mL in 4 to 5 days at various development scales in the PBS Biotech bioreactors: from small scale (0.5L) to development (3L), to pilot (15L) and production (50L) scale. 63 At the 50L scale, this generated lot sizes ranging from 25 billion to 30 billion in a single run, and if scaled to 500 L then this would yield lot sizes north of 250 billion cells-a true commercially relevant lot size. While microcarrier-based cultivation allows us to scale-up, another challenge to keep in mind for clinical manufacturing is the downstream processing steps.
