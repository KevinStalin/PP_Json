Substantial studies have reported that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) has various non-anticoagulant properties that play an anti-inflammatory role by reducing the release of IL-6. [11] [12] [13] However, the anti-inflammatory effects of LMWH in COVID-19 are currently unknown. By analyzing the effect of LMWH in patients with COVID-19, our retrospective cohort study demonstrates, for the first time, the significant beneficial effect of LMWH in controlling cytokine storm and delaying disease progression ( Figure 1 ).",

All cases in this study were located at Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology (Wuhan, Hubei Province, China), a designated treatment hospital for patients with COVID-19. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the hospital. In total, we retrospectively collected the electronic medical records of 42 patients with COVID-19, the admission data for these patients were from February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020 ( Figure 2 shows the case inclusion flowchart) of which 21 patients underwent LMWH treatment (defined as the LMWH group, Table 1 presents the LMWH medication), and 21 did not (defined as the control group), during hospitalization. As a designated hospital for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, our hospital received 850 patients during February 1, 2020, to March 15, 2020. After March 15, our hospital no longer undertook the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Case screening was performed after all patients were discharged from the hospital. Among these, 548 of nonsevere patients (diagnosed according to the New Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis Program (7th edition) published by the National Health Commission of China) were excluded. Of the 302 severe patient group, 145 received LMWH of which 124 were excluded, as indicated in Figure 2 . At this point, we went back to the 157 patients who were not treated with LMWH and decided to enroll the \"first in list\" 21 patients who were found suitable given the exclusion criteria that are presented in Figure 2 . Notably, 32 patients who were not treated with LMWH were eligible for the study, but only the first 21 patients were actually included without any matching attempts or adherence to specific criteria.",

LMWH was reported to reduce the release of IL-6 in the body by inhibiting the expression of NF-\u03baB. [11] [12] [13] Measuring the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in patients with COVID-19, we have found a marked decrease in the levels of IL-6 in the LMWH-treated patients compared with the patients without LMWH treatment (P < 0.001), consistent with the proposed protective effect of LMWH. Changes in other inflammatory factors were not statistically significant. In addition, IL-6 can bind to heparan sulfate (HS) on the cell surface, yielding a sufficiently high local concentration to activate signaling receptors, 18 protect them against proteolysis, and promote paracrine action. 16, 19 An earlier study has reported that heparin binds IL-6, with affinity much higher than that of HS, 16 thereby reducing its availability to its receptor complex. It, therefore, appears that LMWH reduces both the release of IL-6 and its biological activity.",

In individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the level of inflammatory cytokines is markedly higher than normal and held responsible for the severity of the disease. Agelidis et al. documented that upon herpes simplex virus-1 infection, heparanase translocate to the nucleus of the infected cells and promotes inflammatory signaling, mediated primarily via NF-\u03baB. 31 In fact, transcription of IL-6 was significantly decreased after treatment with an inhibitor of heparanase enzymatic activity. 31 LMWH, which inhibits heparanase activity, 28 may have a similar effect, possibly providing a mechanistic explanation for the decrease in IL-6 that we observed in the LMWH-treated patients. Collectively, the above considerations suggest that heparanase inhibitors (i.e., LMWH) may be an effective strategy in a therapeutic or combination therapy against viral infection, including COVID-19. Additional studies showed that inhibition of the glycocalyx-degrading enzymes sialidase, cathepsin L and heparanase, using a combination therapy of zanamivir, There were no significant differences in age, sex, comorbidities, onset symptoms, time from hospitalization to virus shedding, length of hospital stay, antiviral treatment, and disease progression between the two groups.",

Several studies have recommended CRP and LYM% as indices for evaluating the effectiveness of clinical drugs or treatments. 4, 33, 34 In the various analyses applied in this study, there was no statistically significant difference in CRP levels between the two groups, indicating that LMWH treatment has no effect on this parameter. Notably, the changes in LYM% in patients of the LMWH group before and after LMWH treatment were significantly different from those in the control group (P < 0.05), consistent with the results of Derhaschnig et al. 35 This result suggests that LMWH can increase LYM% in patients with COVID-19 and thereby improve their condition. Furthermore, it was reported that proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, can induce lymphopenia. 5 Hence, the decrease in IL-6 ( Figure 3a ) may contribute to the increase in LYM% observed in the LMWH-treated patients.",

This study still has several limitations. First, due to the retrospective design, we were unable to control the time intervals between examinations of the various indices in patients and the LMWH treatment schedule. Likewise, we could not estimate and manage the effective dose and timing of LMWH. Second, there were no critical cases in the two groups of patients; the treatment outcome of all cases was improvement and discharge, and there were no deaths. Finally, the findings are limited by the sample size and single-center design of our study. ",
