To examine the effect of age on death, we established a SARS-CoV-2 infection model in Chinese rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) of varied ages. Results indicated that infected young macaques manifested impaired respiratory function, active viral replication, severe lung damage, and infiltration of CD11b + and CD8 + cells in lungs at one-week post infection (wpi), but also recovered rapidly at 2 wpi. In contrast, aged macaques demonstrated delayed immune responses with a more severe cytokine storm, increased infiltration of CD11b + cells, and persistent infiltration of CD8 + cells in the lungs at 2 wpi. In addition, peripheral blood T cells from aged macaques showed greater inflammation and chemotaxis, but weaker antiviral functions than that in cells from young macaques. Thus, the delayed but more severe cytokine storm and higher immune cell infiltration may explain the poorer prognosis of older aged patients suffering SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Epidemiological data have revealed that aged people are more susceptible to severe illness and are experiencing higher mortality, as reported initially by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team, 2020) . In fact, 81.04% of deaths have occurred in patients aged \u226560 years, whereas only 0.78% of deaths have occurred in patients aged \u226429 years. On 18 March 2020, the United States CDC reported similar data: 62% of hospitalized adult patients were aged \u226555 years, 53% of patients admitted to the ICU were aged \u226565 years, and 80% of deaths occurred in patients aged \u226565 years (US CDC, 2020) . Recent epidemiological study on factors associated with COVID-19 death in 17 million patients further confirms the effects of age on mortality (Williamson et al., 2020) . In addition, aged adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection tend to have more serious clinical features compared with young patients, including higher pneumonia severity, multiple lobe involvement, lower proportion of lymphocytes, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (Kai et al., 2020) .",

The underlying reasons may include decreased immune function and increased pro-inflammatory factors caused by immunosenescence (Yuki et al., 2020) . However, the immunological pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in aged patients remains unclear. Such issues can be studied in detail in aged non-human primate (NHP) models, where repeated sampling and tissue collection are possible with fewer ethical concerns when under the approval of an institutional animal care and use committee. Therefore, in the current study, we infected Chinese rhesus macaques (ChRMs) with SARS-CoV-2 to explore the role of immunological changes in disease progression.",

The positive rates of viral RNA varied between the two groups of ChRMs ( Figure 1C ): 50% of throat swabs at all time points were positive in the young ChRMs, higher than that in nose and rectal swabs. Compared with young animals, aged ChRMs showed lower positive rates in nose swabs (32% vs. 4%), throat swabs (50% vs. 9%), and rectal swabs (41% vs. 14%), indicating that more false negatives for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be reported in elderly patients when using these sampling methods. Surprisingly, positive rates of viral RNA in tracheal brushes were much higher than that in swabs in both young (92%) and aged ChRMs (75%) ( Figure 1C ). Therefore, viral detection in tracheal brush samples may be more reliable for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, peak viral loads in tracheal brush samples from three young and one aged ChRM were more than 10 000 copies/mL, suggesting young macaques have more robust viral replication in the first wpi.",

As shown in Figure 2B , a decreased breathing rate, increased pCO 2 , and decreased pH were detected at 1 wpi in young ChRMs, but these indices all returned to normal at 2 wpi.

In addition, the viral loads in lung tissues at 7 dpi were higher in young ChRMs than aged macaques. Based on antibodies and viral loads in lungs, those macaques (#15333, #15341, #01055) with antibodies also showed an obvious decrease in lung viral loads compared with data on 7 dpi. However, the macaque (#03055) without antibodies showed no differences in lung viral loads compared with data on 7 dpi.

Although there were no statistical differences in the concentrations of cytokines between young and aged macaques at 7 dpi, the average concentrations of most cytokines were higher in young ChRMs than in aged ChRMs, implying that young macaques may show greater immune response at 1 wpi. However, the concentrations of cytokines in aged ChRMs were significantly higher than that in young macaques at 2 wpi. This strongly implied that aged macaques experienced more severe cytokine storm at 2 wpi. Compared with the data at 7 dpi, the average concentrations of most cytokines decreased slightly at 15 dpi in young macaques, suggesting that young ChRMs slowly recovered from the disease at 2 wpi.

In addition, increased expression of CD38 and Ki-67 indicated that immune activation was also a common feature of the two groups. These characteristics are consistent with the common phenotypic changes found in T cells after viral infection. It is worth noting that the frequency of CXCR3+CD4 + /CD8 + began to rise rapidly within 3 dpi, when T-bet+CD4 + /CD8 + T cells decreased rapidly. Furthermore, the proportion of IFN-\u03b3+CD8 + and TNF\u03b1+CD4 + /CD8 + T cells in the aged group also increased significantly at 2 wpi ( Figure 5 and Supplementary Figure S2 ). However, these phenomena were not found in young animals.

Accordingly, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms and characteristics of viral infection, which may help in the development of vaccines and treatments to drastically reduce COVID-19 transmission. Due to their physiological similarity and phylogenetic proximity, NHPs are considered the most suitable animal models to recapitulate aspects of human biology and disease (Colman et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2014 Zhang et al., , 2019 , and have been widely used in studies on coronavirus infections, such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Gao et al., 2003; Haagmans et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2007) . Rhesus macaques have also been shown as a suitable animal model for COVID-19 study (Munster et al., 2020; Shan et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020a) . Similar to the clinical features of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, virus replication and shedding, presence of pulmonary infiltrates, histological lesions, and seroconversion have been found in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques. Lu et al. (2020) also compared SARS-CoV-2 infection among three species of NHPs, i.e., Macaca mulatta, M. fascicularis, and Callithrix jacchus, based on clinical signs, viral RNA in swabs and tissues, and histopathological changes, and found M. mulatta to be the most susceptible animal model to SARS-CoV2 infection, followed by M. fascicularis and C. jacchus. In addition, a SARS-CoV-2 infection model has been established in African green monkeys, in which a much lower and more natural dose of SARS-CoV-2 was used (Woolsey et al., 2020) . Recently, we successfully established and evaluated a new SARS-CoV- 2-infection animal model using Chinese tree shrews, which are genetically close to NHPs .",

Similar to that reported in other rhesus macaque models (Lu et al., 2020; Munster et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020b) , increased rectal temperature, positive viral RNA in swabs, brushes, and lung tissue, dot infiltration in Xrays, and interstitial pneumonia were detected in all young animals, confirming the successful establishment of a SARS-CoV-2 infection model. Compared with previous monkey model studies (Lu et al., 2020; Munster et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2020b) , we added an additional method for detecting viruses in tracheal brushes, and found that the positive rate of viral RNA in these brushes was much higher than that in nose, throat, and rectal swabs in both young and aged groups. The positive rate of viral RNA in brushes and swabs from young macaques was higher than that from aged ones, although the reasons for this are not known (Yu et al., 2020b) . Lung tissues Figure 4 Immunofluorescence staining of immune cells in lungs of young ChRMs dissected at 7 dpi showed more active virus replication and more serious lung damage and inflammatory infiltration compared to aged macaques. However, at 2 wpi, young macaques showed better improvement in respiratory function, reduction in viral RNA in lung tissues, restorative and limited interstitial pneumonia, and decreased levels of cytokines in plasma. In contrast, aged animals had relatively moderate inflammation and pathological features at 1 wpi but showed significant levels of cytokine storm and infiltration of CD11b+ cells at 2 wpi. These results suggest that the aged macaques experienced a delay in the development of disease symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, and thus may have a more complicated pathogenic mechanism that awaits elucidation.",

A plausible hypothesis is that the aging immune system is more heterogeneous and dysfunctional, thus rendering it ineffective at controlling viral infections (Franceschi et al., 2017; Fulop et al., 2017) . The reduced plasticity of alveolar macrophages to convert between pro-and anti-inflammatory states can lead to the accumulation of dust, allergens, and pathogen remnants in the lungs (Kovacs et al., 2017) . Neutrophils progressively lose their ability to migrate to sites of infection during aging (Mahbub et al., 2011) . In addition, common effects of aging on the adaptive immune system include increased thymic atrophy, increased memory T cells and T cell metabolic dysfunction, na\u00efve T cells, weakened T cell activation, reduced CD8 + T cell diversity, and decreased CD4 + T cell activation (Ongr\u00e1di & K\u00f6vesdi, 2010; Ron-Harel et al., 2018; Salam et al., 2013; Yoshida et al., 2017) . These potential mechanisms may act independently or in coordination to influence clinical outcomes in patients with There is a possibility that a dysfunctional innate immune system in aged adults may be weakened and unable to recognize the virus to induce an immune response in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 has evolved an effective mechanism to escape the host's innate immunity, as evidenced by its higher replication rate and lower interferon induction compared to SARS-CoV . In this case, the host's early outbreak of type I interferon plays an active role in the development of severe COVID-19 (Lee et al., 2020; Park & Iwasaki, 2020; Trouillet-Assant et al., 2020) . In contrast, the delayed production of interferon may be detrimental to the antiviral response (Channappanavar et al., 2019) . The latter situation usually plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in infected elderly patients and experimentally infected mice (Huang et al., 2005; Rockx et al., 2009) . Our results showed that young macaques did not display obvious T-cell chemotaxis or functional changes within the first 2 wpi, whereas the immune response of aged macaques was delayed until 7 dpi, as demonstrated by the expression of IFN\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in peripheral CD8 + T cells and elevated levels of inflammatory factors in the lungs at 2 wpi.",

This can lead to substantial infiltration of inflammatory cells into the tissue and induction of lung damage (Lau et al., 2013; Law et al., 2005) . In our study, although viral loads in aged animals were not higher than that in young macaques, this did not show any benefit. Instead, their lungs demonstrated a more severe inflammatory cytokine storm and granulocyte infiltration at 15 dpi. Similarly, previous studies have indicated that aged NHPs infected with SARS-CoV have the same level of respiratory virus titers as young NHPs but have more severe disease manifestations due to excessive inflammation (Smits et al., 2010) . Many studies have found that a rapid and coordinated immune response during the early stage of viral infection is conducive to resisting the spread of the virus, and dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause damage to the body. Even more seriously, uncontrolled local and systemic inflammation might have fatal consequences in SARS-CoV-2 infection (Channappanavar et al., 2016; Davidson et al., 2015; McGonagle et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Our results suggest that excessive inflammation, rather than a high viral titer, contributes more to disease progression in SARS-CoV-2-infected aged animals as a consequence of chronic subclinical systemic inflammation and acquired immune system damage during aging. Continuously increasing levels of inflammatory factors causing a sluggish acquired immune system and lung tissue damage and viral replication also seem to occur in elderly COVID-19 patients (Mehta et al., 2020) . In some studies, immunological aging of lymphocytes has been linked to a weakened immune response to emerging infectious diseases, a decrease in the number of effector cells, and an inability to resist infection (Brien et al., 2009; Smithey et al., 2011) . In previous study, we found that, in comparison to mild patients, severe COVID-19 patients exhibit a loss of polyfunctionality and elevated exhaustion in T cells, which have the characteristics of immune aging . The fact that a large proportion of these severe patients are middle-aged or elderly suggests that immunological aging may facilitate disease progression in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our current study agrees with this assertion, as both young and aged macaques demonstrated typical immune aging characteristics after infection, such as reduced na\u00efve T cells and increased T-cell differentiation. The difference was that under immunological aging and viral infection interaction, CXCR3 expression increased whereas T-bet expression was significantly downregulated in T cells of aged macaques. This indicates that T cells in aged macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit enhanced chemotaxis and decreased antiviral function. These characteristics limit T cell chemotaxis to the infection site to exert antiviral functions but keep mounting a strong inflammatory response (Pritchard et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2018; Stone et al., 2019) .",
