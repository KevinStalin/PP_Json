This is despite politicians' claims that anti-social behaviour reflects a moral decline. This article draws on a focus group study from the North West of England and on ideas from criminology and philosophy. People's assessments of anti-social behaviour are found to be informed by judgements of morality, most often in terms of 'doing what's right', having respect, and abiding by the Golden Rule, to 'do to others what you would have them do to you'. Understandings of anti-social behaviour are stretched so far by the public that they can range from littering through to tax avoidance, but what these behaviours have in common is their perceived breaching of our day-to-day moral standards. Implications are discussed.",

            "text": "Over recent decades, many jurisdictions have focused attention on behaviours variously labelled as minor nuisances, incivilities or anti-social behaviours such as littering, noisy neighbours, through to loitering youths or on-street drug dealing (e.g. Millie 2009a; Per\u0161ak 2018) . In the UK, successive governments have framed antisocial behaviour as a moral concern. For instance, in the late-1990s and early 2000s Tony Blair's New Labour government implemented a major policy focus on antisocial behaviour culminating in what was ambitiously called a 'Respect Agenda' (Millie 2009b) . Anti-social behaviour was seen as reflecting a moral decline that could be reversed through instilling a 'culture of respect' (Respect Task Force 2006: 5) , and this was backed by the threat of enforcement. According to MP Jack Straw, one of the architects of the government's approach, there was a 'rising tide \u2026 the street is experienced as having fallen into the possession of an army of hoodies, aggressive beggars, muggers, chavs and binge drinkers. The Respect Agenda, with its assorted baggage of ASBOs, 1 parenting orders 2 and neighbours from hell, is simply a new chapter in this gloomy, ceaseless narrative of decline. And within this narrative the younger generation, their morals perceived to be perpetually spiralling downward and always younger in the onset of their depravity, figures both as a lament for things lost and a harbinger of worse to come. (2009: 66-67) If Pearson was right concerns about anti-social behaviour simply reflected perpetual intolerance towards the next generation of young people who had always challenged the morals and beliefs of their elders. The experiences of victims were real, but there had been no moral decline. Behaviours that were labelled as anti-social were nothing new (see also Pickard 2014 ).",

Politicians were dealing with the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and more recent Prime Ministers Theresa May and Boris Johnson have had other all-consuming issues in the form of exiting the European Union and the Covid-19 pandemic. The anti-social activities of a minority seemed less urgent. Yet anti-social behaviour had not gone away. For instance, in March-April 2020 during the early peak of the Covid-19 crisis, whilst many reported crimes in England and Wales apparently declined, 3 there seemed to be a dramatic rise in reports of anti-social behaviour. According to the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) the rise was likely linked to breaches of the lockdown (Shaw 2020)-the implication being that behaviours previously thought of as anti-social may not have increased, but the public's perception of what constituted anti-social behaviour had expanded to include breaches of the new Covid-19 legislation 4 (although such breaches may have also included 'traditional' anti-social behaviours as well). The point is that perceptions of what constitutes anti-social behaviour may have expanded to fit the new circumstances.",

There were 50 participants across all groups, aged from 19 to 69. The participants included 34 females and 16 males. It is acknowledged that focus groups have limitations and that other forms of data collection are possible such as the use of police data on reports of anti-social behaviour. However, for this project it was thought that a qualitative focus on perceptions (rather than reports) would be more fruitful in gaining understanding of people's differing ideas of what constitutes everyday morality and anti-social behaviour-which may or may not be based on reported incidences. The three towns were selected to represent a range in terms of measures of deprivation, based on scores from the 2010 English Index of Multiple Deprivation (EIMD) produced by the Office for National Statistics (DCLG 2011). The first was Skelmersdale which represented one of the most deprived locations nationally. Out of 32,482 Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOAs) across England, Skelmersdale town was ranked 2971. On a more local level, the Digmoor area of Skelmersdale had a score of just 283. The second location Rainford was the third least deprived area within the St Helens Borough with a ranking of 27,603. The third area, St Helens town, represented mixed deprivation ranging from very low ranks (44) to much higher ranks of very little deprivation (30,074).",

With such a range of behaviours the usefulness of the term 'anti-social behaviour' may be lessened. What these behaviours had in common was their perceived breaching of our day-to-day moral standards. Anti-social behaviour is often assumed to be perpetrated by groups of young people and spatially concentrated within areas of social housing (Brown 2004) . One of the authors has previously highlighted that this may be because this is where agencies have been looking for anti-social behaviour (Millie 2007) . The participants in this study did identify young people as potential perpetrators, but some were also aware that this was a stereotype. They identified other groups and situations where people's behaviour could be regarded as anti-social. It was found to be a label applied following moral judgement and was not unique to any particular social group or type of neighbourhood. Implications are discussed.",

This contrasts with a deontological perspective that emphasises doing one's duty or following rules, or consequentialism which focuses on the outcomes or consequences of actions (see, e.g. Millie 2016). In making a moral judgement concerning what is or is not anti-social it is possible that combinations of these three are used discretely or in combination. For instance, littering may be described as morally wrong and therefore anti-social because it breaches society's norms and rules (deontological), or because it has a detrimental impact on the environment (consequentialist), or perhaps because it reflects poor character in the litterer (a virtue ethics explanation). Political narratives of moral decline often adopt a consequentialist position. For instance, as cited above, MP Jack Straw (1996) identified a 'rising tide of disorder' that had the consequence of 'blighting our streets, parks and town centres'. David Cameron (2008) adopted a combination of virtue ethics (that 'we seem to have abandoned the habits of all human history') and deontology ('that in a civilised society, adults have a proper role-a responsibility-to uphold rules and order in the public realm'). It is possible that the public similarly switches between different approaches to understanding moral action, and therefore how behaviours are interpreted as anti-social.",

Whilst such questions can be applied to the major moral issues of our time they are also applicable to our everyday moral decisions, including what is deemed to be anti-social. Within moral philosophy there has been for many years the notion of a common morality or a common sense morality that refers to everyday, ordinary values and norms. According to Tom Beauchamp (2003: 260) a common morality is 'the set of norms shared by all persons committed to the objectives of morality\u2026 it is applicable to all persons in all places, and all human conduct is rightly judged by its standard'. It is suggested that a common morality is a universal minimal moral sentiment of every morally serious person. Yet we do not all think the same and different cultures and societies can adopt quite different moral positions-something a moral relativist would emphasise. For instance, writing over a century ago Edward Westermarck (1906: 742) noted how: 'A mode of conduct which among one people is condemned as wrong is among other people viewed with indifference or regarded as praiseworthy or enjoyed as a duty'. The danger of a fully relativist position is that it can allow for quite abhorrent behaviours simply because they are approved by different cultures or societies (Millie 2016 ). The alternative is that some actions will always be wrong. The relevance to the current article is that the public may understand anti-social behaviour (and the everyday moral assessments that inform perceptions of what is anti-social) in terms of universal truths or relatively.",

To adopt this imperative we aim to act only in ways that we wish everyone to act. Therefore, we do not litter because we do not wish for littering to become a universal law (Millie 2016 ). We would not want others to litter on our property, so we do not litter on theirs. Similarly, we do not automatically condemn groups of youths who are congregating because we would not want others to condemn us for meeting with our friends.

For some participants in the current study such a shared morality exists; as one participant put it, '\u2026 people make common sense assumptions about people' (P1, Rainford Focus Group 1). Another participant stated that, 'everyone should basically know\u2026 right from wrong' (P1 from Skelmersdale Focus Group 3). Yet for others, behaviours can be interpreted differently. A relativist perspective was put forward by P2 from Skelmersdale Focus Group 3: \u2026 because some people can deem one thing moral,\u2026 you know religious morality and personal morality and sometimes they clash dramatically and then if you're trying to force one and then the other there's literally borders between borders and borders when it comes to morality. Some people deem an action of shooting a criminal as being good\u2026 Whilst people may make 'common sense assumptions', they might not come to the same conclusions-as one participant from Skelmersdale recounted: \u2026 I've witnessed what other people have told me is anti-social behaviour, but I haven't actually agreed\u2026 like gangs of youths who\u2026 where I live near, hadn't actually done anything, but it's a different section of people, that actually make that into a problem and say that's anti-social behaviour. (P5, Skelmersdale Focus Group 2) When discussing anti-social behaviour many recounted stories of their own experiences. It seemed that anti-social behaviour was something known personally to them because they had lived it, or they knew another individual or group that had experienced it. Perceptions of what constituted anti-social behaviour were heavily influenced by these stories, rather than picking from a list of officially defined behaviours. For instance, in one St Helens focus group: \u2026 and where we've lived we've had eggs thrown at window, because we didn't fit in, because it was a street where it was like Beirut, (P3, St Helens Focus Group 1) I've had me car scratched up, I've had me windows smashed in, I've had nails put into me tyres (P2, St Helens Focus Group 1) What were being described may have been more serious breaches of criminal law on harassment and criminal damage 5 ; yet for these participants what they had experienced was also anti-social. Similar personal experiences were described by another participant, this time a local religious leader: I suppose as much as the parish before that where I was in Liverpool\u2026 the vicarage before, almost every night really, broken into, vandalized. We had a new roof put on, that was vandalized,\u2026 stealing cars and driving them around the back of the vicarage setting fire to them, every night that went so that was anti-social behaviour.

(P5, Skelmersdale Focus Group 1). Similarly, another participant stated, 'yeah being respectful to others\u2026 Just treat them the way you'd like to be treated yourself' (P6, Skelmersdale Focus Group 1). A participant from Rainford stated 'I think morality is about trying to do the right thing and respect other people, treat people how you'd like to be treated.' (P3, Rainford Focus Group 2). Kant' s Formula of Universal Law might be a useful starting point-to: 'Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law ' (1785/1990: 1031) . The emphasis on respect and the language of the 'Golden Rule' would be familiar to Kantian ethicists (Hill 2000) . Some participants put this in the context of family, religion and cultural background; as P1 from Skelmersdale Focus Group 3 put it, \u2026it comes from religion and it's also cultural as well.

No one lives an entirely morally good life, despite political claims for the existence of a law-abiding or moral majority. Yet, more participants saw a direct link between everyday morality and anti-social behaviour. Some reiterated the view from government that it reflects a moral decline-and that this was related to a decline in respect and in standards of parenting. For instance: \u2026 but I think also a lot of families, parents don't, respect's a two-way thing, and I don't think the children are shown respect. So how can parents expect their children to show them respect and, you know, I was brought up to respect my elders\u2026 (P1, Rainford Focus Group 3) \u2026 it's totally different from when we were younger, there's no respect for your elders, there's no respect for the police, no respect for the fire service, for any emergency service, and I wouldn't like to be in their shoes. There's no respect whatsoever, no one's frightened of anything\u2026 and I mean that\u2026 as in a younger generation they're not frightened of anything, there's just no respect anywhere whether it be at school, at home\u2026 but a lot of it comes from the home, definitely. (P1, St Helens Focus Group 2) 'Bad parenting' and 'problem families' are frequently blamed for society's problems, but this is a simplification (Peters 2012) . Having less automatic deference to our supposed superiors is also not necessarily a bad thing (Millie 2009b) . But the perception is that there has been a moral decline as reflected in a decline in respect and in parenting skills. Whether this is true is another issue and is based upon perception and levels of tolerance (Mackenzie et al. 2010) .",

Some participants regarded certain behaviours as always antisocial, although these behaviours included more than might be imagined based on any official list and often included behaviours that could be classified as criminal. Others adopted a relativist perspective that anti-social behaviour can stretch depending on individual perception and context. Either way, what made these behaviours anti-social was their perceived breaching of everyday moral standards. Participants most often explained everyday morality in terms of: (1) Darwall (1977) there are two kinds of respect-a recognition respect that acknowledges inherent dignity in others irrespective of what they have done (that has overlaps with Kant's Formula of Humanity as an End in Itself), and an appraisal respect that is earned on merit, such as respect for winning a race. Returning to the politics of anti-social behaviour, New Labour's Respect Agenda and other government-led 'civilising offenses' have centred on the notion that respect has to be earned (Millie 2009b) . Recognition respect would be the more egalitarian.",

As for ideas of respect, the notion of recognition respect (including respect for those perceived as anti-social) may be a useful place to start in creating a more empathetic approach (Millie 2016) to anti-social behaviour policy. At the very least anti-social behaviour policy might adopt a position where all are treated with dignity or 'how you'd like to be treated'.",
