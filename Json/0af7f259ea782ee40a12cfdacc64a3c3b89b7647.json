            "text": "Klebsiella pneumoniae has a remarkable ability to cause a wide range of human diseases. It is divided into two broad classes: classical strains that are a notable problem in health care settings due to multidrug resistance, and hypervirulent (hv) strains that are historically drug sensitive but able to establish disease in immunocompetent hosts. Alarmingly, there has been an increased frequency of clinical isolates that have both drug resistance and hv-associated genes. One such gene, rmpA, encodes a transcriptional regulator required for maximal capsule (cps) gene expression and confers hypermucoviscosity (HMV). This link has resulted in the assumption that HMV is caused by elevated capsule production. However, we recently reported a new cps regulator, RmpC, and \u0394rmpC mutants have reduced cps expression but retain HMV, suggesting that capsule production and HMV may be separable traits. Here, we report the identification of a small protein, RmpD, that is essential for HMV but does not impact capsule. RmpD is 58 residues with a putative N-terminal transmembrane domain and highly positively charged C-terminal half, and it is conserved among other hv K. pneumoniae strains. Expression of rmpD in trans complements both \u0394rmpD and \u0394rmpA mutants for HMV, suggesting that RmpD is the key driver of this phenotype. The rmpD gene is located between rmpA and rmpC, within an operon regulated by RmpA. These data, combined with our previous work, suggest a model in which the RmpA-associated phenotypes are largely due to RmpA activating the expression of rmpD to produce HMV and rmpC to stimulate cps expression. IMPORTANCE Capsule is a critical virulence factor in Klebsiella pneumoniae, in both antibiotic-resistant classical strains and hypervirulent strains. Hypervirulent strains usually have a hypermucoviscosity (HMV) phenotype that contributes to their heightened virulence capacity, but the production of HMV is not understood. The transcriptional regulator RmpA is required for HMV and also activates capsule gene expression, leading to the assumption that HMV is caused by hyperproduction of capsule. We have identified a new gene (rmpD) required for HMV but not for capsule production. This distinction between HMV and capsule production will promote a better understanding of the mechanisms of hypervirulence, which is in great need given the alarming increase in clinical isolates with both drug resistance and hypervirulence traits.",

The pathology of hvKp is more severe than that typical of cKp and can include pyogenic liver abscesses, necrotizing fasciitis, meningitis, and endophthalmitis (8, 9) . Of particular concern is the emergence of strains with both hypervirulent (hv)-associated genes or traits and the multidrug resistance that is characteristic of cKp (10) . Antibiotic resistance genes are often carried on plasmids (11, 12) , and many of the genes corresponding to hypervirulence are carried on large virulence plasmids or mobile genetic elements incorporated in the chromosome (13) (14) (15) . That these genetic entities can be horizontally transferred suggests there is an increased risk of strains acquiring both hypervirulence and multidrug resistance (16, 17) . Alarmingly, there have been recent reports of extensively resistant hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (18, 19) , and multiple strains where both hv-associated genes and antimicrobial resistance genes were present on the same mobile vector (20) (21) (22) (23) . These reports of convergence of hypervirulence and antimicrobial resistance in the same strain have heightened the need to better understand how hypervirulence genes interface with a strain's genetic background to confer hypervirulent phenotypes. This is particularly important given the extensive diversity of genetic content between K. pneumoniae strains.",

            "text": "RmpA is a LuxR-like transcriptional regulator frequently encoded on virulence plasmids or on integrative chromosomal elements (ICEKp) and was initially discovered as a regulator of HMV (14, 27) . While the strong correlation between the presence of rmpA and hypervirulence has made it a key biomarker for hvKp (24, 30) , we still know very little about how rmpA contributes to HMV and hypervirulence. Previous studies established that loss of rmpA decreases capsule (cps) gene expression and reduces HMV in commonly used hvKp strains (31, 32) . We recently confirmed these rmpA-dependent phenotypes in the hvKp strain KPPR1S (28) . We also described another regulator of capsule gene expression, RmpC, which is encoded downstream of rmpA; rmpA and rmpC are cotranscribed from the same promoter that is positively regulated by RmpA (28) . Like rmpA mutants, the rmpC mutant showed reduced cps gene expression but, unlike rmpA mutants, retained HMV. We further showed that overexpression of rmpA in the wild type (WT) or the \u0394rmpA and \u0394rmpC mutants increased HMV. However, overexpression of rmpA did not restore cps expression in the \u0394rmpC strain, and overexpression of rmpC elevated cps expression even in the \u0394rmpA strain (28) . These data suggest that (i) RmpA is an important determinant for HMV but RmpC is not, (ii) reduced cps expression in the \u0394rmpA strain is likely a consequence of reduced rmpC expression rather than direct regulation by RmpA, and (iii) high levels of cps expression are not necessary to confer HMV. The latter conclusion stems from the fact that the \u0394rmpC mutant has reduced cps expression and capsule production (by uronic acid assay) but retains the HMV phenotype and that exogenous expression of rmpA in the \u0394rmpC strain results in elevated HMV without restoring cps expression (28) . Importantly, this was the first clear evidence of a separation between capsule expression and HMV and suggests that HMV is not simply a consequence of elevated capsule production.",

The \u0394rmpD mutant is non-HMV, has no change in cps expression, and produces the same amount of uronic acid (capsule) as the wild-type parental strain. This provides corroborating evidence that HMV and capsule production result from distinct processes. Expression of rmpD is sufficient to confer HMV to a \u0394rmpA mutant. It is transcribed by the promoter upstream of rmpA and therefore is also regulated by RmpA.

Having observed that hypermucoviscosity (HMV) is not necessarily a consequence of elevated capsule expression from examining the individual \u0394rmpA and \u0394rmpC strains with complementation plasmids (28), we took one further step by similarly testing a strain that lacked the region harboring both rmpA and rmpC (strain \u0394rmpAC). We predicted that introduction of pRmpA would restore HMV and that pRmpC would restore cps expression. Because the string test for HMV is qualitative, HMV was assessed by measuring the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600 ) of culture supernatants following low-speed centrifugation, an established assay for HMV (31) (32) (33) (34) ; all string test-negative strains pellet tightly, while string test-positive strains remain turbid. Expression of capsule genes was monitored using a promoter-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter fused to manC (manC encodes an enzyme that makes one of the K2 sugar precursors and is located in the cps locus). The manC promoter is the third of three characterized promoters in the capsule locus. The galF promoter is regulated by RmpA and RmpC in a similar manner as manC, and the wzi promoter is not regulated by these proteins (28) . While pRmpC resulted in elevated manC levels in the \u0394rmpAC mutant as expected, pRmpA failed to restore HMV in this mutant ( Fig. 1A and B) . However, introduction of a plasmid containing the entire region that was deleted resulted in elevated HMV, suggesting an element contained within the intergenic space was necessary for HMV. In examining this region, the open reading frame (ORF) prediction function in Geneious R11 identified a small ORF between rmpA and rmpC (Fig. 1C) . We cloned this predicted ORF with its putative ribosome binding site (RBS) into pMWO-078, transformed it into KPPR1S, \u0394rmpA, \u0394rmpC, and \u0394rmpAC strains, and assayed for HMV (Fig. 1D ). Introduction of this plasmid (pRmpD) resulted in a hyper-HMV phenotype in all strains, including the \u0394rmpAC strain. Thus, this gene is required for HMV and was named rmpD. Transcriptional readthrough of the intergenic regions between rmpA-rmpD and rmpD-rmpC indicates rmpD is within the rmp operon ( Fig. 1C ) that is autoregulated by RmpA (28) .",

The other known promoters in the capsule locus (galF and wzi) showed no expression defects in the \u0394rmpD mutant (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). Supporting the notion that it is rmpD and not rmpA that is necessary for HMV, pRmpA was unable to restore HMV in the \u0394rmpD mutant. Introduction of pRmpC into the \u0394rmpD strain resulted in the same high levels of manC expression observed in other strains but did not restore HMV. Complementation of \u0394rmpD with pRmpADC (formerly pRmpA-C) also resulted in an elevated level of HMV. The cultures in which rmpD is overexpressed become extremely viscous and have the consistency of a thick syrup (see Fig. S2 ) but have no change in transcription of manC (Fig. 2) . Collectively, these data suggest that rmpD is directly necessary for HMV. Given that RmpA regulates the promoter driving expression of rmpADC (28) , the well-established role of RmpA as a requisite factor for the HMV phenotype is likely due to its function as a transcriptional activator of rmpD expression.",

Contributing to assumptions in the field that HMV is derived from capsule, mutants in hvKp strains that produce no or reduced levels of capsule have also typically been reported as non-HMV (31, 32, 34, 36) . To further probe the distinction between capsule production and HMV, we transformed two capsule mutants (\u0394manC and \u0394wcaJ) with pRmpD to determine if these strains could become hyper-HMV. manC encodes a GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase that produces UDP-mannose, one of the sugar precursors of K2 capsule, and wcaJ encodes the initiating glycosyltransferase (undecaprenyl phosphotransferase) involved in building the four-sugar K2 subunit. Both capsule mutants, with or without pRmpD, fully sedimented following low-speed centrifugation ( Fig. 4A ), suggesting that the HMV phenotype requires some capsule biosynthetic enzymes and may require capsule production. We therefore examined capsule production in the \u0394rmpD strain using the uronic acid (UA) assay. There was no decrease in UA levels in the \u0394rmpD strain compared to that in the WT, and addition of pRmpD did not lead to increased UA (Fig. 4B ). Collectively, these data imply that production of capsule is not impacted by RmpD but that at least some components of capsule must be present in order to become HMV. The negative stain, India ink, can be used to visualize capsule as zones of exclusion surrounding the bacterial cells. We stained WT, \u0394rmpD, and \u0394manC strains with and without pRmpD to examine the zones in these samples; all strains also expressed gfp to verify presence of the bacteria. WT bacteria showed exclusion zones that varied somewhat in size, whereas the rmpD-deficient bacteria had thinner uniform exclusion zones (Fig. 5) . When rmpD was overexpressed in either strain, the bacteria had uniformly large exclusion zones. As predicted, no exclusion zones were observed from staining of \u0394manC bacteria, although the field had ample bacteria present. Given that there was no difference in the amount of UA between the WT and \u0394rmpD strains, these data suggest that the material forming the abundant exclusion zones is different from a typical UA-containing capsule and that the HMV material also excludes the stain. There are several known regulators of capsule gene expression, of which, our lab has identified three and studied five (28, 36) . These mutants (\u0394rmpA, \u0394rmpC, \u0394kvrA, \u0394kvrB, and \u0394rcsB) all have reduced UA levels and capsule expression, and all but \u0394rmpC are from several hvKp strains were identified using Geneious Prime, cloned, and expressed in either WT or \u0394rmpD strains, which were assayed for mucoviscosity.

            "text": "KPPR1S produces the enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and LPS. A recent report showed that mutants in LPS and ECA pathways had reduced HMV (determined by sedimentation) (34, 37) . To more clearly ascertain if either of these exopolysaccharides contributed to HMV, we tested a strain with a disruption in wecA, which encodes an undecaprenyl phosphotransferase; this mutant produces normal levels of UA but lacks both LPS and ECA and is attenuated in the pneumonia model (38) . The wecA mutant showed WT-like HMV and became hyper-HMV when rmpD was overexpressed (see Fig. S5 ). Thus, LPS and ECA are not likely to be directly required for HMV. However, this does not rule out the possibility that other mutations in these pathways could have pleiotropic effects leading to reduced HMV. Additionally, it is possible that some enzymes required for LPS or ECA could contribute to HMV independently of their role in LPS or ECA. rmpD contributes to immune evasion and virulence. One of the virulence phenotypes associated with capsule is the blocking of adherence and phagocytosis (39) . To determine if HMV specifically contributed to these processes, we performed adherence and internalization assays with the macrophage-like J774A.1 cell line. The WT strain showed approximately 5% adherence, and the \u0394manC mutant showed nearly 70% adherence (Fig. 7A) . The \u0394rmpD strain behaved like the acapsular manC mutant, with \u03f385% adherence. The WT or \u0394rmpD strains with pRmpD were virtually nonadherent, with less than 1% of the bacteria attached. This reduction was not observed in the \u0394manC mutant with pRmpD, most likely because it remains non-HMV. Because the \u0394rmpD strain still produced capsule at the WT level and the attachment phenotype was the same as a capsule mutant, it appears that the HMV phenotype, rather than capsule per se, is the main factor blocking attachment to host cells. A similar trend was observed for internalization of these strains (Fig. 7B) . Less than 1% of WT cells were intracellular, and approximately 35% of the \u0394manC bacteria (with and without pRmpD) were intracellular. No bacteria were recovered from WT or \u0394rmpD with pRmpD. Only ap- proximately 6% of the \u0394rmpD bacteria were internalized; this is significantly more than WT but also significantly less than the \u0394manC mutant. These results suggest that (i) HMV blocks both adherence and internalization and (ii) capsule-positive strains are still somewhat protected against phagocytosis, even if non-HMV. Collectively, HMV appears to provide the primary barrier to adherence, while capsule and HMV each contribute to prevention of phagocytosis by macrophages. Based on the results of the in vitro virulence-associated assays, we next tested the \u0394rmpD mutant in our mouse pneumonia model and found it to be essential for virulence in vivo. At 24 h postinoculation (hpi), the \u0394rmpD mutant was recovered from the lungs at levels approximately 4 logs lower than that of the WT and was essentially cleared by 72 hpi (Fig. 7C) . In the spleens, the \u0394rmpD mutant was recovered at lower numbers than the WT at 24 hpi, but WT levels were often low at this time point (Fig. 7D) . However, by 72 hpi, the WT colonized the spleens to \u03f310 8 CFU/g and the rmpD mutant was not recovered. A strain with the rmpD gene restored at the native site (rmpD comp ) behaved like the WT, indicating that the defects observed from \u0394rmpD were indeed due to loss of rmpD.",

RmpA has been established as an essential factor for HMV, and rmpA mutants also show reduced capsule gene expression (28, 31, 32) . Thus, it has long been assumed that the HMV phenotype was a consequence of abundant capsule production in excess of that observed in classical strains. This arose despite statements in some early studies that HMV did not appear to be linked to capsule production (27, 40) . However, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) staining of an hv K. pneumoniae strain incubated with K2 antisera suggested the extracapsular substance associated with HMV contained capsular material (41) . Although it has been 30 years since the discovery of RmpA, no direct regulation by RmpA of cps expression (or that of other genes) has been demonstrated. In our investigations into the contributions of RmpA to hypervirulence, we confirmed its role in HMV and cps expression but also ascertained that the mechanisms contributing to these phenotypes are much more complex than had been presumed (28) . We identified a downstream gene encoding RmpC, a putative transcriptional regulator that modulates cps expression, and found that rmpA and rmpC are in an operon that is autoregulated by RmpA. RmpA and RmpC have distinct functions in that the \u0394rmpA mutant is non-HMV but the \u0394rmpC mutant retains HMV. Both mutants have similar reductions in cps expression; however, overexpression of rmpC complements cps expression even in strains lacking rmpA. While RmpC has also not been demonstrated to directly regulate cps promoters, these data indicated that RmpA was not likely to be a direct regulator of the cps gene. We thus concluded that RmpA controlled HMV while RmpC controlled cps expression in work that provided the first clear evidence separating the phenotypes of HMV and capsule levels.",

Namely, pRmpA did not restore HMV to this \u0394rmpADC mutant, but a plasmid containing the entire deleted region (pRmpADC) did restore HMV. In the present study, we report the initial characterization of RmpD, a small protein encoded in the region between rmpA and rmpC and within the rmp operon. The data presented here suggest that RmpD is the key factor driving the HMV phenotype. Collectively, our data support a model in which the role played by RmpA in the HMV and cps expression phenotypes is to activate expression of rmpD and rmpC. This is evidenced by (i) the restoration of HMV in the \u0394rmpA and \u0394rmpADC strains with pRmpD, and restoration of cps expression in the \u0394rmpA and \u0394rmpADC strains with pRmpC, and (ii) the inability of pRmpA to restore HMV in the \u0394rmpD strain or cps expression in the \u0394rmpC strain. Given that several RmpD orthologs were able to complement HMV in the \u0394rmpD strain and that rmpD is present in strains that also have rmpA and rmpC, we speculate that RmpD is part of a conserved mechanism conferring HMV to K. pneumoniae. Little information can be gleaned about how RmpD acts from sequence and structural analyses. It is predicted to be \u2423-helical and anchored in the inner membrane by an N-terminal transmembrane domain with the C terminus positioned in the cytoplasm. As the C-terminal region of all RmpD orthologs contains a number of positively charged residues, we speculate that these charges allow for specific protein-protein interactions that mediate the HMV phenotype.",

            "text": "Several lines of evidence further support the notion that production of capsule and HMV are separable. First, deletion of rmpD did not alter UA levels, suggesting that production of the capsular material is unaffected by this mutation. Second, strains that are hyper-HMV from overproduction of RmpD did not produce more UA than the WT strain. Third, trans expression of rmpD was able to restore HMV in the regulatory mutants (\u0394rmpA, \u0394kvrA, \u0394kvrB, and \u0394rcsB), that all have reduced cps expression and capsule production and are non-HMV. Each of these regulators activate transcription of the rmpADC promoter (28); thus, the loss of HMV in these mutants is most likely due to reduced expression of rmpD. Curiously, even though we can detect almost no expression from the manC promoter in the \u0394rcsB strain (28) , introduction of pRmpD in the \u0394rcsB mutant, but not in the \u0394manC mutant, results in hyper-HMV. Either very low levels of mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase are sufficient for HMV production or HMV does not actually require this enzyme and the HMV defect in a \u0394manC strain is an indirect effect of loss of this gene. Lastly, a recent study has identified several K. pneumoniae transposon mutants with normal capsule production and reduced HMV (42) .",

Both mutants pellet tightly and are highly adherent to host cells. The hyper-HMV strains (WT and \u0394rmpD with pRmpD) are essentially nonadherent, but the non-HMV \u0394manC plus pRmpD strain remains highly adherent. This raises the question as to whether the antiadherence property of hvKp is dependent on capsule or on HMV. Given that the \u0394rmpD strain is encapsulated, it appears that HMV is a more critical determinant for blocking adherence. This is consistent with the non-HMV \u0394rmpA strain having a more severe virulence defect than the HMV-positive \u0394rmpC strain in the mouse pneumonia model (28) . Enumeration of bacteria internalized by J774A.1 cells showed a similar trend to adherence, except that the \u0394rmpD strain was internalized less efficiently than the \u0394manC strain. These data appear to suggest that HMV is a stronger deterrent to adherence than capsule, but that both capsule and HMV provide protection against phagocytosis in an additive manner. As this is the first attempt to examine strains with defects in HMV but not capsule production, similar analyses will need to be performed in other hvKp strains to determine if these trends are generally applicable or unique to KPPR1S. In the in vivo pneumonia model, the \u0394rmpD mutant is severely attenuated, with a defect similar to that of the \u0394rmpA mutant (28) . This reinforces that HMV is an essential virulence factor in immunocompetent mice and suggests that capsule, while certainly providing some protection against host defenses, is insufficient in the absence of HMV for establishment of a lethal infection in mice. These data illustrate how HMV distinctly contributes to the hypervirulence of K. pneumoniae isolates. Support for this comes from reexamination of the virulence defects of the \u0394rmpA and \u0394rmpC strains. While it is possible that RmpA regulates additional virulence factors, the loss of rmpD expression in the \u0394rmpA mutant likely contributes to the stronger virulence defect in the \u0394rmpA mutant than in the \u0394rmpC mutant. Similarly, analysis of KPPR1 genes essential for infection in a mouse pneumonia model identified mutations in VK055_5096 as deficient for virulence (33) . This orf is located immediately upstream of rmpA (VK055_5097), and the transposon insertion quite likely impaired expression of the rmp locus. Furthermore, the virulence plasmidborne rmp locus was found to be associated with liver abscess formation by NTUH-K2044 (43) .",

            "text": "Complicating the notion that HMV is not simply a consequence of overabundant capsule production is that hyper-HMV did not occur in capsule-deficient mutants carrying pRmpD. This suggests that strains can be capsule positive/HMV positive or capsule positive/HMV negative but not capsule negative/HMV positive. One possible explanation for this is that the HMV material is capsular but that the export is altered in the presence of RmpD. This situation would mean that even reduced levels of biosynthetic enzymes such as those found in the regulatory mutants are sufficient to yield the extra polysaccharides. A second explanation is that HMV is a polysaccharide distinct from capsule, but that some cps-encoded functions are required to produce this material. A third possibility is that the HMV material is a modified form of capsule, and the presence of RmpD influences synthesis or export of the altered polysaccharide. That capsule-like material is part of HMV material is supported by the K2-positive staining of the HMV substance from a WT strain but not from non-HMV mutants (41) .",

Of significant concern is the number of recent reports of strains with both multidrug resistance and hvassociated genes, including rmpA (and quite likely rmpD and rmpC) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . These strains are genetically quite distinct (including capsule type) from the hvKp that have been circulating, and it is not known to what degree acquisition of the rmpADC locus will impact HMV and virulence of these strains. While we have shown that RmpD from either a K2 or K1 strain can confer HMV in a K2 strain, it is not clear if there is capsule type specificity for this RmpD function. We also do not know, beyond a few cps genes, what, if any, other genes are necessary to confer HMV or if these genes are conserved in all K. pneumoniae strains. A better understanding of what is required for HMV and how genetic background influences the HMV-associated hypervirulent phenotypes will be important for determining the risks associated with carbapenem-resistant (CR) cKp strains that acquire rmpADC.",

To further probe the factors necessary for HMV, we transformed the \u0394kvrA, \u0394kvrB, and \u0394rcsB strains with pRmpD and assessed HMV and capsule phenotypes. When the respective deleted gene was complemented in trans with pKvrA, pKvrB, or pRcsB, each mutant had WT-like HMV, elevated UA levels, and elevated manC and galF expression (seeFig. S4). With pRmpD, the \u0394kvrB and \u0394rcsB strains became hyper-HMV similarly to the WT strain, and an intermediate level of HMV was observed for the \u0394kvrA strain(Fig. 6A).
