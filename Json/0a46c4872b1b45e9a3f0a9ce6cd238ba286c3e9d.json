We present a case of a patient with Crohn's disease on adalimumab (ADA) and ustekinumab (UST) combination therapy who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

He experienced secondary loss of response to infliximab despite dose escalation to 10 mg/kg in combination with methotrexate (MTX). He was then transitioned to ADA, and his dose was escalated to 40 mg weekly in addition to MTX (he subsequently self-discontinued MTX because of intolerance). The patient achieved clinical response but not clinical remission using ADA. Magnetic resonance enterography showed active inflammation in the terminal ileum, distal sigmoid colon, and rectum ( Fig. 1) . A colonoscopy showed ulcerated mucosa in the terminal ileum and at the ileocecal valve with narrowing and patchy, mild pancolonic inflammation. The patient's ADA level was 17 mcg/mL without antibodies.",
