The cytosolic domain of human 12 TMEM39A binds to Sec23A, a vesicle coat protein that drives collagen secretion and 13 vesicular trafficking. TMEM-39 regulation of collagen secretion is independent of ER 14 stress response and autophagy.

            "text": "including autoimmune diseases, brittle bone diseases (too little collagen), tissue 23 fibrosis (too much collagen) and aging-related disorders (2-7). The multi-step 24 biosynthesis of mature collagen by the cell is a complex process and involves 25 procollagen gene transcription and protein translation, posttranslational modification, 26 assembly into procollagen trimers inside the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), vesicular 27 secretion from ER, extracellular peptide cleavage and cross-linking into collagen fibers 28 (1, 8) . 29 Specific mechanisms underlying the secretion of procollagen still remain poorly 30 understood. In general, specialized intracellular vesicles defined by the coat protein 31 complex II (COPII) transport most secreted proteins, including procollagen, from the 32 ER to the Golgi apparatus (9, 10). Sec23, Sec24, Sec13 and Sec31 comprise COPII 33 coat proteins, while the transport protein particle (TRAPP) complex acts a key tethering 34 factor for COPII vesicles en route to the Golgi (11-13). Typical COPII vesicles are 60 35 to 80 nm in diameter, which is not sufficient for transporting procollagen trimers with 36 up to 300 to 400 nm in length (14). In mammals, large-size COPII-coated vesicles may 37 transport procollagen from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. TANGO1, a transmembrane 38 protein at the ER exit site, mediates formation of specialized collagen-transporting 39 vesicle and recruitment of procollagen (14-16). The N-terminal SH3-like domain of 40 TANGO1 binds to the collagen chaperone HSP47 in the ER lumen, recruiting 41 procollagens to the ER exit site (17). Its C-terminal proline-rich domain (PRD) servers 42 as a COPII receptor by interacting with the inner shell proteins Sec23/Sec24 (18). The 43 coil-coil domain of TANGO1 forms a stable complex with cTAE5 and SEC12, which is 44 particularly enriched around large COPII carriers for procollagen (19) . Through its 45 membrane helices, TANGO1 organizes ER exit sites by creating a lipid diffusion barrier 46 and an export conduit for collagen (20) . While requirement of TANGO1 for secretion 47 may depend on specific collagen types, it remains unclear whether TANGO1's 48 functions are broadly conserved in all animals (21, 22) . 49 Caenorhabditis elegans produces over 180 collagen members that constitute the 50 cuticle and basement membranes, encodes conserved homologs of COPII/TRAPP 51 proteins, yet lacks apparent TANGO1 homologs (23-26). This indicates that 52 evolutionarily conserved and TANGO1-independent mechanisms may exist in C. 53 elegans to regulate procollagen secretion. From a genome-wide RNAi screen for 54 genes affecting ER stress response, we previously identified tmem-131 that defines a 55 broadly conserved family of proteins important for procollagen assembly and secretion 56 (22). Mutations in specific collagen genes, conserved COPII/TRAPP-encoding 57 homologs, and impairment of collagen biosynthetic pathway components are known 58 to result in a range of phenotypes including ER stress response, abnormal cuticle-59 associated morphology (Blister and Dumpy), and early death or growth arrest (23). Table) and found that tmem-39 RNAi knock-down strongly reduced 114 abundance of the COL-19::GFP reporter (Fig 2A) . COL-19 is a C. elegans exoskeleton 115 collagen that is secreted by the underlying hypoderm and required for integral structure 116 of the cuticle (23). The C-terminal GFP-tagged COL-19 reporter enables highly robust 117 and tractable visualization of the cuticle morphology and to identify defects in the 118 collagen production machinery (27) Using confocal microscopy to characterize the structure of hypodermal cuticle, we 140 found that in control RNAi animals, COL-19::GFP is enriched in the hypoderm, 141 constituting regular annular furrows and lateral alae of the cuticle (Fig 2B) . In the tmem-142 39 RNAi animals, COL-19::GFP appeared to be clustered in the intracellular region of 143 hypoderm, and largely absent in the cuticle (Fig 2B) . We further analyzed the 144 abundance and composition of COL-19::GFP proteins by Western blot. Besides strong 145 reduction of overall COL-19::GFP abundance, tmem-39 RNAi markedly increased the 146 soluble \"premature\" monomeric procollagens, while decreased the insoluble fraction 147 of cross-linked multimers and \"mature\" monomers of COL-19::GFP (Fig 2C) . 148",

We examined collagen secretion phenotypes of other genes involved in protein 272 modification and homeostasis in the ER identified from the asp-17p::GFP screen, 273 including ostb-1, nus-1, stt-3, dlst-1, ost-3 and uggt-1 (Fig 5A and S4 Table) .

However, sac-1 RNAi did not affect the ER stress 306 response reporter hsp-4p::GFP (Fig 6B) or COL-19::GFP (Figs 6C-D) . We also 307 examined RNAi phenotypes of let-363, which encodes an ortholog of human mTOR 308 (mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase) and regulates autophagy in C. elegans (45, 309 46). Similarly as sac-1 RNAi, let-363 knock-down in C. elegans showed a marked 310 induction of tts-1p::GFP but has no apparent effects on collagen secretion (Figs 6 E-311 G).

RNAi knock-down of sec-23 and most other COPII genes 340 recapitulated the tmem-39 loss-of-function phenotypes in constitutively high ER stress 341 response, defective collagen secretion and sensitivity to osmolality stress in C. elegans 342 (Table 1 ). We also noticed that RNAi knock-down of many COPII related genes, such 343 as sec-23, sec-24.1, npp-20, sar-1, sec-12, rab-5 and trpp-8 caused more severe 344 phenotypes than tmem-39 RNAi, leading to lethality or developmental arrest that 345 prevent collagen phenotype analysis (Table 1) Recent work showed that TMEM39A facilitates the ER-to-Golgi transport of SAC1 and 355 regulates autophagosome formation (28). We found that RNAi knock-down of 356 autophagy related genes, such as sac-1 and let-363, caused autophagy induction but 357 did not affect the ER stress response or collagen secretion (Fig 6) . Genes identified 358 from the asp-17p::GFP screen that regulate the ER stress response also did not affect 359 collagen secretion (S4 Table) , further supporting the notion that roles of TMEM-39 in 360 collagen secretion are independent of ER stress response and autophagy. 361 Besides Sec23A, additional interactors were identified from Y2H screens with the 362 TMEM39A cytoplasmic domain as bait. We verified the interaction between full-length 363 DCTN6 (1-190 a.a.) and TMEM39A (337-420 a.a.) (Fig 4D) . DCTN6 is a subunit of the 364 dynactin protein complex (47) that acts as an essential cofactor of the cytoplasmic 365 dynein motor to transport a variety of cargos and organelles along the microtubule-366 based cytoskeleton (48, 49). In mammalian cells, ER-to-Golgi transport proceeds by 367 cargo assembly into COPII-coated ER export sites (ERES) followed by 368 vesicular/tubular transport along microtubule tracks toward the Golgi in a 369 dynein/dynactin-dependent manner (50). Sec23p directly interacts with the dynactin 370 complex (50), indicating that TMEM39A may participate in a Sec23/DCTN6 complex 371 to facilitate COPII coat assembly and subsequent dynein/dynactin-dependent 372 transport. Test of this hypothetic model and determination of the underlying mechanism 373 in relation to TMEM131's role in collagen secretion await further investigations. 374",

Animals at the 419 same stage were randomly picked from the plate, and transferred to a 4% agar pad 420 with 10 mM sodium azide and 1 mM levamisole in M9 solution (31742-250MG, Sigma-421 Aldrich) on a slide for imaging.

Ct values of specific genes were normalized to the C. elegans 447 housekeeping gene act-1 levels. Results were presented as fold changes to respective 448 references. Statistical significance was determined with t-test, using GraphPad Prism 449 7. Primer sequences are listed in Supporting information S2 Table. Drosophila Resource Center ID# 42509/GD). Lsp2-Gal4 is 453 specifically expressed in the fat body cells. Flies expressing Collagen:RFP in fat body 454 were crossed to either wild type or UAS-CG13016_dsRNA flies.
