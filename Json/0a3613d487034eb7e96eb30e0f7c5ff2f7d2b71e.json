Although the etiology and pathophysiology of PTS remains unclear, the syndrome has been reported in the postoperative, postinfectious, and post-vaccination settings, with recent viral illness reported as the most common associated risk factor (Beghi et al., 1985 [2]). Various viral, bacterial, and fungal infections have been reported to precede PTS, however, currently there are no reported cases of PTS in the setting of recent infection with . We present a case of a 17 year old female patient with no significant past medical or surgical history who presented with several weeks of severe joint pain in the setting of a recent viral illness (SARS-CoV2, .

It is characterized by acute onset of severe shoulder pain, most commonly unilateral, which may extend to the arm and hand [1] . The pain is often constant and is not positional in nature. It is usually self-limiting and may last for 1-2 weeks, although less frequently, persistent pain has been reported [1] . PTS is also characterized by associated delayed upper extremity weakness, muscle atrophy, and painless paresthesias, which tend to slowly and gradually resolve [3] . Although most patients report 80-90% recovery of muscle strength at 2-3 years, greater than 70% of patients experience residual paresis and exercise intolerance [4] .",

After underlying malignancy, rheumatologic disorder, and hypereosinophilic syndrome were ruled out, sequelae of a post COVID-19 hyperinflammatory syndrome such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) likely explains this patient's symptoms, serum and pathologic analyses, and imaging findings. This is further supported by the initial improvement in symptoms after administration of oral corticosteroids. While a post-viral hyperinflammatory syndrome is a well-known cause of PTS, it has not been reported in a case of recent infection with SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) , as demonstrated in our patient. The number of cases of SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19) continues to rise worldwide and this post-infectious syndrome is an increasingly significant possible etiology of pain in a patient with suspected PTS.",
