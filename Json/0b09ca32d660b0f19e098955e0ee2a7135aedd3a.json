It has been proposed that testing of asymptomatic individuals with the isolation of cases and contact tracing could reduce the prevalence of the disease and end the pandemic 4 . In Australia, restriction measures were first implemented on 23 rd of March (with the closure of bars, clubs, cinemas, places of worship, casinos and gyms), and two days later the country closed its borders 5 . As part of the mitigation strategy, the Victorian state government implemented a screening \"blitz\" in the last week of April. The purpose of this was to screen a large number of people and therefore allow for contact tracing and physical isolation of positive asymptomatic individuals prior to easing of restrictions. After a peak in the number of cases at the end of March both in Australia and the state of Victoria, a steep decline in the daily number of new cases became evident, and restrictions were gradually and progressively eased since the second half of May 5 . Estimates of the infection rates among asymptomatic individuals in Australia are currently scarce and, given that physiological changes imposed by pregnancy could lead to increased susceptibility, it is unknown whether the prevalence of asymptomatic infection in pregnancy reflects that of the general population.",

However, within the pandemic context, pregnancy represents a unique situation as women have multiple interactions with the health care system and most are ultimately admitted to the hospital for childbirth. Therefore, pregnant women may be a source of infection to others who they encounter during their frequent attendance to healthcare facilities, so it is vital to understand the rates of asymptomatic infection in this population. While pregnant women with symptoms may be undergoing testing in general clinics, few studies opportunistically targeted a population of asymptomatic pregnant women.",

In the weeks that preceded testing of asymptomatic women, we had adopted the following strategies in our three maternity hospitals to reduce exposure of patients, relatives and staff: a significant number of antenatal consultations (approximately 60%) were shifted to a telehealth model, with face-to-face appointments reserved for visits at 28, 36 and 40 weeks of pregnancy, or when deemed necessary by the attending health professional; all women were routinely asked about recent travel, known contacts and the presence of recognised COVID-19 symptoms; if symptoms were present, women were advised to attend the COVID-19 screening clinic and not to attend their antenatal appointment; all women attending the clinic or the hospital had body scanning temperature check on arrival; no support persons were allowed during clinic J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f consultations or ultrasound examinations, and only one support person was allowed during labour and birth; and all health care professionals attending births wore personal protective equipment (PPE) after appropriate training.

Each infected person is likely to infect on average, a measure known as R0, between 2.2 and 5.7 individuals 11, 12 , if measures to reduce transmission such as physical distancing and hands hygiene are not implemented. Universal testing has been proposed not only to reduce transmission rates and avoid an overload of the health systems but also as an alternative strategy to reduce economic and social damage during relaxation of restriction measures, with strict household quarantine after a positive test 13 . Feasibility, cost and effectiveness of such policy have not, however, been evaluated. In addition, it is unlikely that one single strategy will be enough to assuage the disease burden. Instead, it is the combination of J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f different effective measures that will be able to mitigate the enormous consequences of the pandemic 2, 3 .",

We found no positive tests in either group during this low prevalence period, which was consistent with the population estimates at the time. The findings of this study suggest that widespread testing of asymptomatic pregnant women may not be necessary in periods of low community transmission. Additionally, since pregnant women are no more susceptible to infection than others 6, 7, 14 , population prevalence estimates may be reliably extrapolated to pregnant women. In Australia, mitigation measures such as the closure of the borders and restriction rules were implemented relatively early in the pandemic. The early introduction of these measures likely explains the lower prevalence and fatality rates than most other high-income countries. Indeed, of all tests performed in Victoria since the beginning of the pandemic, 0.8% were positive 5 . The real positivity (prevalence) rates were likely even lower because community testing has been focussed on those with symptoms, albeit with a progressively lowering threshold for those symptoms.",

The number of daily cases is decreasing. Although the reassuringly low disease prevalence among pregnant women found in our study may not hold in higher prevalence periods, our findings remain valid to inform policy as Victoria makes its way through the \"roadmap to recovery\" outlined by the State Government. The threshold of community transmission above which testing of asymptomatic childbearing women is warranted remains to be investigated. In the state of Victoria, there are currently 1,008 confirmed active cases 1 . Considering a state population of 6.63 million inhabitants 18 , the prevalence rate of the infection is estimated at 152 per one million inhabitants (as compared to 52 cases per one million inhabitants during the study period). The interpretation of the epidemiology will need to be revisited as the community transmission rates rapidly change with the pandemic dynamics. Our study was conducted between the first and the second infections waves and, although the prevalence found can no longer be considered representative of current disease rates due to markedly increased community transmission, infection rates in pregnancy can still be assumed to be similar to those of the general population. In high prevalence periods, identifying pregnant women who carry the virus is important to allow for treatment of symptomatic individuals, physical isolation of carriers, contact tracing, and implementation of correct PPE to reduce transmission risk during antenatal consultations, laboratory testing, ultrasound examinations and during birth that may involve an aerosol-generating procedure such as maternal effort in the second stage of labour or endotracheal intubation for general anaesthesia (if required) during caesarean deliveries.",

Our sample did, however, include a group of women with potential symptoms of COVID-19, whose test results were negative. A single nasopharyngeal swab may potentially fail to identify a proportion of infected individuals 19 , and it has been suggested that serial testing may be necessary to minimise false-negative results 13 . These issues are, however, less problematic in low prevalence populations, in which the predictive value of a negative result is high, reliably ruling infection out in asymptomatic individuals.",

The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of pregnant women with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Continuous variables were assessed for normality by inspection of histograms and quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots. Since the distributions of continuous baseline variables were not Gaussian, metric and ordinal variables were summarised as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Categorical variables were expressed as absolute number and percentage. The proportion of positive results was reported with its 95% confidence interval, obtained by the exact binomial method. Statistical analysis was performed in Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp. 2019. Stata Statistical Software: Release 16 for Macintosh. College Station, TX: StataCorp LLC). Review of the screening results was approved by the local Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number QA/66029/MonH-2020-219471).",
