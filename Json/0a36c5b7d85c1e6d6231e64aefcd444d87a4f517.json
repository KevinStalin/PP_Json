The problem of the juridical conception of biological samples for medical research lies in their two-sided nature as collections of cells and as sources of health and genetic data (12). With emphasis on the exquisitely material nature of these samples, intense debate has revolved around the ownership of biological samples (13) (14) (15) (16) , and the legal relationship that binds the subjects to the samples, when the latter have been separated from their bodies.",

            "text": "For some authors (17) , when diagnostic or treatment procedures call for the ablation of material or parts from the body, even though the procedure does not cause a permanent reduction of physical integrity, these materials or parts are in effect separated from the body, and as such acquire the nature of disposable personal property (art. 810 c.c.), within the limits of legal provisions already in vigor (art.5 c.c.) and are the object of ownership just as any other good (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) . The most recent thought, however, has confuted the existence of a ius in se ipsum, arguing that after the separation, the body parts become external things, and thus can be owned. Thus, there is a foundation for the claim that these tissues have been abandoned and that they can be taken by those who are interested in using them, because \"for the most part, they offer the persons neither an interest of use nor an interest of exchange, \" and consequently, with the separation, these goods become res nullius (24) as derelict or abandoned, and thus can be acquired (25, 26) . A certainly original theory draws a parallel between the law on separated parts of the body and that on works of creativity, based on the concept that just as a subject owns works of his/her creativity, so the individual should be deemed the owner of his/her own biological material (art. 2576 cc). According to this juridical construction, the part removed is a res that was created by the subject, albeit with the help of the surgeon, and therefore the subject should be the sole owner (25) .",

There are two possible interpretations of this principle, a more radical one and a more permissive one. An initial reading (36) excludes a priori any possibility of constituting patrimonial rights over the body and human tissues even after their separation from the body. The more permissive theory (32) refers to the impossibility of using individual parts of the body for gain, ensuring the freedom and spontaneity of donations on the basis of the rule of the extra-patrimonial nature of the circulation of rights over the human body. However, the solution is not easy, because the relationship of ownership entails a series of rights and faculties that must subsist in order to claim full ownership of something; clearly, this cannot be the case with biological samples, which are considered goods extra commercium, and cannot be disposed of for gain, because this would be an affront to human dignity, the protection of which is grounded in the Constitution of the Italian Republic (art. 2).",
