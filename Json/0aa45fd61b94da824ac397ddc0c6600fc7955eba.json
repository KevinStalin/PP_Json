The one-step RT-PSR was accomplished at the optimal temperature of 62 \u2022 C and time of 40 min and used primers simply designed as conventional PCR primers, and the results of detection were visible to the naked eye. The detection limit of PSR was above 34.7 copies/\u00b5L at a 95% probability level according to probit regression analysis. The assay specifically detected N-GoAstV, and no other reference viruses were detected. These results suggest that the newly established RT-PSR assay could, in one step, accomplish reverse-transcription, amplification, and result determination providing a visible, convenient, rapid, and cost-effective test that can be carried out onsite, in order to ensure timely quarantine of N-GoAstV-infected birds, leading to effective disease control.",

            "text": "Astroviruses (AstV) are small non-enveloped RNA viruses that can infect many hosts, including humans (1), livestock, poultry, domestic pets (2), even bats (3) , and aquatic birds (4) . Since February 2016, some goose farms in the Shandong Province of China experienced an outbreak of disease characterized by hyperuricemia and urate depositions to the viscera and joint capsules and even under the skin of goslings at 1 to 3 weeks of age. This was diagnosed as gout (5, 6) . The disease impacted the birds' motor functions and feed intake, leading to emaciation and death. The cause of the gout outbreak in goslings had been confirmed to be novel goose astrovirus (N-GoAstV) (6, 7) . An increasing number of cases of astrovirus-infected goslings developing gout has been reported since December 2017 (6) , and this condition occurs persistently in some provinces, causing huge economic losses to the poultry industry (7) (8) (9) . Therefore, effective control of these N-GoAstV infections and the development of diagnostic methods for simple, rapid, user-friendly, and efficient detection of N-GoAstV are imperative.",

            "text": "Traditional immunological methods are not ideal for diagnosing novel pathogeny due to the complex preparation required and the need to screen out highly specialized antibodies in the serum. Various molecular-based methods, including reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (5) and reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (10, 11) have been successfully implemented to diagnose N-GoAstV in clinical samples. Despite the fact that these methods offer rapidity, specificity, and sensitivity, they cannot be widely used in the field because of the sophisticated procedures involved and the requirement for expensive instrumentation (12) . To solve these problems of detection, assays based on PCR technology and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) have been implemented for N-GoAstV detection (13) . Additionally, a novel nucleic acid amplification method called polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) has also been developed to amplify the target sequence within a short time (usually 1 h or less) under isothermal conditions (60 \u2022 C\u221265 \u2022 C) (14) . Recently, the PSR assay or reverse transcription PSR (for pathogens with RNA genomes) has been extensively used for the identification of bacteria, viruses, and even for molecular pathology analyses (15) (16) (17) . Hence, we developed a one-step RT-PSR method for detecting the N-GoAstV in this study.",

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, no commercial vaccines or effective therapeutic schedules have been set up to control the goutrelated disease caused by N-GoAstV. Thus, establishment of a rapid and simple detection method is imperative. Although some PCR-based methods have been successfully used and have proven effective for N-GoAstV detection (5, 7, 10, 11) , the complicated test procedures and expensive equipment required limited their extensive practical use. In the recent years, to circumvent the need for professional laboratory equipment, many detection methods including LAMP and PSR assays were invented for use under isothermal conditions (14-16, 19, 20) . However, the RT-LAMP assay for N-GoAstV detection requires two primer pairs to target at least six sequence regions and strict primer coordination. Since the N-GoAstV sequences occur in many mutations, primers are easily mismatched resulting in failure to match with GoAstVs sequences (7) . Compared with PCR and qPCR, PSR needs only a single pair of primers and no sophisticated equipment or professional technicians, resulting in cost savings and an extended range of application. Based on these advantages, PSR should offer a viable alternative method by which to detect N-GoAstVs both at point of care and on-site. In this study, the PSR method was used to diagnose N-GoAstV and shown to be an excellent detection method for N-GoAstV. The primers designed were simpler in PSR than those in LAMP and were selective only in the target region of N-GoAstV in the same way as in conventional PCR primers. The optimum reaction conditions were temperature at 62 \u2022 C and a time of 40 min. Hence, the reaction can be conducted in a water bath, meaning that the test is readily accessible. In established LAMP assays, Yu et al. used SYBR Green I dye to display a remarkable dissimilarity between positive and negative reactions, but the dye cannot be added before the reaction starts because of its inhibitory effect (21) . This means the reaction must be uncovered in order to add the dye, increasing the risk of aerosol cross-contamination. SYTO 9, SYTO 82, SYTO 16, SYTO 13, and Miami Yellow-different from SYBR Green I, -were found to be the best dyes with no inhibitory effect in the real-time LAMP reactions (22) . Whether these dyes in high concentration could be used for visible observation by the naked eye under natural light needs further evaluation. In this study, we used a different color indicator, including phenol red and cresol red, which had been developed for use in RT-LAMP assays as previously described (13) . The specificity of the primers was verified by detecting the pathogenic agents N-GoAstV, GPV, GREOV, GHPV, and TMUV, and only the N-GoAstV produced a ladder pattern, indicating that the method established was highly specific. The practicability of the RT-PSR test for clinical diagnosis was determined by testing 235 samples from goose farms in the field and further confirmed by sequencing of the amplified products of positive samples. The RT-PSR test displayed perfect concordance between virus isolation and RT-LAMP. The high success rate may have been due to the high viral load of the 186 positive samples (Ct value by RT-qPCR performed on the same samples were all determined to be below 27) (13) . Meanwhile, alignment of sequences of some products also indicated the conservation of the primer targeting region, which also supported the high success rate (Supplementary Figure 2) . Moreover, referring to the development of the LAMP assay, performing RT-PSR with crude RNA preps (e.g., detergent or boiling lysis), would make it suitable for field use profit by Bst polymerase which theoretically be less affected by potential inhibitors within the samples (23) . Meanwhile, a multiplexing-PSR assay using some kind of fluorophore and quencher reporter could be developed in a well-equipped laboratory since the number of primers is small.",
