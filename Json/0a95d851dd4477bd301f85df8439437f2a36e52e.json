In contrast with prior efforts focusing on connections at a distance or online communities where the digital technology is the interface, we explore the design opportunities and role of technology for connectedness within a geographically local community context. We present findings from interviews with 22 older adults and a linked ideation workshop. Our analysis identified shared concerns and negative perceptions around local relationships, connections and characteristics of the geographical area. However, local connectedness through technology was largely absent from day-to-day life and even perceived as contributing to disconnection. By uncovering how older adults use and perceive technology in their social lives and combining these findings with their ideas for improving local connections, we highlight the need for thoughtful consideration of the role of technology in optimising social connections within communities. Our research highlights a need for design work to understand the specifics of the local context and reduce emphasis on technology as the interface between people. We introduce an amended definition-'underpinned by a commitment to respect and social inclusion, an age-friendly community is engaged in a strategic and ongoing process to facilitate active ageing by optimising the community's physical, social and digital environments and its supporting infrastructure'-to conceptualise our approach.

Our starting point for the linked workshop was to consider some of these 'gaps' in local connectedness that interview participants had described. The workshop activities were used to facilitate participants in thinking creatively about addressing specific local challenges, or 'gaps' in connectedness.

We also draw on concepts from environmental gerontology, such as 'ageing in place' to understand the importance of the local area in older people's lives. An overarching premise of an age-friendly community is that it is 'friendly for all ages and not just \"elder-friendly\"' [1] . Even so, the argument that older people are 'able to remain more independent by, and benefit from, ageing in environments to which they are accustomed' [4] makes it all the more important to consider how environments can support people 'ageing in place' to optimise their social connectedness within their local area. This has become even more apparent during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed the need for digital connection as an alternative to face-to-face interactions.

Warnings of the 'loneliness epidemic' and its associated public health implications are prevalent in media discourse [5] [6] [7] , and the UK government appointed the world's first minister for loneliness in 2018 [8] . Accordingly, responses to the drive for increased social connection have often focused on mitigating unpleasant experiences, risks and deficits at an individual level [9] . Efforts along these lines reflect and uphold persistent ageist stereotypes that fail to acknowledge the roles that older people (can) play in communities, or their potential to contribute innovative ideas or create a voice for themselves [10] [11] [12] . Indeed, technology is often presented as the ideal way of solving these 'problems' faced by older adults [13] . Ten Bruggencate et al. draw our attention to the predominant focus on loneliness and/or isolation in studies about social technology, ageing and relationships [14] . In contrast, a growing body of work on social connectedness in later life challenges the image of older people as lonely and isolated. Population ageing is leading to increasing numbers of older people, thereby increasing the number of older people in society who experience loneliness. However, loneliness affects only the minority of older people, including the oldest old [15] [16] [17] . The likelihood of reporting feeling lonely decreases with age, with younger adults (16-24 years) reporting loneliness more often than those in older age groups [18] . While older adults may have smaller social networks, they are often more involved in the community than younger adults-socialising with neighbours, participating in religious organisations and volunteering [19] .

The design, or adoption, of digital technology to support social relationships in later life often results in technology being the core interface for connection between people, rather than a route to facilitating face-to-face connections by overcoming barriers. For example, online communities are promoted as presenting opportunities for older people to meet and interact with peers [21] [22] [23] [24] . In this interfacing role, technology is a bridge across distances. Lindley et al. comment that much HCI research related to relationships focuses on ways to maintain feelings of connectedness or express intimacy at a distance [25] . Distances being bridged may be geographical, for individuals living in remote areas or wanting to connect with people with whom they share interests, friendship or familial bonds. Distances may also be generational, where, despite intentions to the contrary, technology replicates asymmetrical family interactions [23, 26, 27] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 500, "end": 504, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 505, "end": 509, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 510, "end": 514, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 515, "end": 519, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 748, "end": 752, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1069, "end": 1073, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1074, "end": 1077, "text": "26,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1078, "end": 1081, "text": "27]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Related Work"}, {"text": "Growing proportions of older people are now using digital technologies. In the UK, 83% of adults aged 65-74, and 47% of adults aged 75 and over use the internet [28] . Thus, the majority rather than a minority of older people are technologically connected, suggesting a need to understand more about how this diverse population uses, and feels about, technology for connecting with others. The few studies that have explored older people's attitudes towards, and perceptions about, communication and connection suggest that rich interactions are valued above lightweight connections offered by newer technologies [14, 25, 29] . Again, this work primarily considers the capacity of digital technology to bridge geographical or generational distances, where more traditional technologies such as telephone and email are often preferred. Thoughtful and meaningful interactions are the goal, and technology provides the interface. Research methods centre around questions about how older adults use, or would choose to use, technology in their social relationships. For instance, Sayago et al. report on research with 700 older people (across six studies) that examined situated technology use and the reasons why participants did, or did not, incorporate particular forms into their everyday lives [23] .

While participants used, for example, Facebook to find out information about the local area, most did not post or share information or send messages to others. Instead, these interactions took the form of face-to-face conversations. On this basis, the authors conclude that proximity and face-to-face contacts should be kept in mind when designing online community networks.

This would be a fundamental approach for any community engaged in the ongoing process becoming (more) age-friendly. An effective strategy in one community will not necessarily translate to a community with different geographical, social or structural features. Likewise, the attitudes of older people towards technology will vary individually and across communities and countries. In their 'manifesto for change' in age-friendly cities and communities, Buffel et al. emphasise the necessity of ensuring the empowerment and recognition of older residents in order to achieve age-friendliness [31] . For these reasons, we adopted a bottom-up, place-based approach that can be responsive to local needs, preferences and resources.

This facilitated the exploration of each individual's own concerns, meanings and priorities related to their social lives, rather than these being imposed by predetermined questions [36] . The same question was asked at the beginning of each interview: 'Can you please tell me the story of your social life while you've been living in [this area]; your relationships with family, friends, neighbours and other people?'. Participants were asked to talk about any events and experiences that were important for them, and invited to take as long as long as they needed to tell their story. This narrative section of the interview was followed by supplementary probing questions to explore areas of particular interest, including the role of technology in their social lives.

Table 2 outlines the four themes, along with linked examples from the interview data. Beginning with the first of the four themes, most participants reported that there were few places in the immediate local area that they could use for socialising beyond their own homes. They described how there was no central community centre in the area, and no clearly distinguishable main high street. Perceptions about the lack of local options contrasted with participants' opinions about the venues, centres and caf\u00e9s available in other areas where they felt that community spaces and caf\u00e9s were prominent and actively used and adopted by people living there. Some participants were happy to socialise at home, but others saw this as too much of a burden or did not feel comfortable inviting people into their home. A noteworthy and unique characteristic of the local area highlighted by participants was the historic covenant on the land in the vicinity, preventing any licensed premises or pubs from operating. In the face of limited options in terms of usable spaces, local churches often hosted (or were booked to host) activities and events. However, this itself was a deterrent to some participants who felt uncomfortable attending events that had a religious connection-even if religion was not intended to be part of the event, such as a community caf\u00e9. Overall, the perspective was that the community's physical features and built environment did not facilitate face-to-face social activities and interactions.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 313, "end": 320, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Opportunities to Improve Connections at a Local Level"}, {"text": "The second theme (not knowing neighbours well) did not apply to all interview participants. In fact, some participants described their neighbours as good friends. These interviewees lived in quieter, more spacious streets, accommodating larger houses with gardens. Other interview participants felt very disconnected from their neighbours. Those living in particularly 'neighbourly' streets were aware that their situations were unusual in the wider local area where different road and housing types and tenures were more dominant, and fewer longstanding residents were living alongside the same neighbours for extended time periods. Population churn, the movement of people in and out of streets, was perceived as a factor influencing the extent to which participants knew their neighbours. Growing families and the number of properties available to rent in the area were cited as reasons behind this movement. Streets were often busy with traffic-a factor that participants identified as not being conducive to unplanned meetings or chats with neighbours. While the physical proximity of neighbours potentially offered the most geographically close opportunities for social interaction, this had not translated into actual interactions for many participants. In particular, participants indicated that local issues of population mobility and transport routes contributed to the under-development of these relationships.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Opportunities to Improve Connections at a Local Level"}, {"text": "The essence of the third theme (a lack of shared community feeling) was expressed by many participants. Some attributed the absence of community to the area's geographical characteristics and location within the wider city, including the proximity of a motorway and the absence of a central focal point, or main high street, in the area. Interview participants also commented on the lack of interaction between people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds, despite the fact that the area was home to a diverse population. Some talked about how this had been a longstanding issue, first noticed when their children were at school.

Even when participants were meeting people and seeking new friendships, these interactions did not often translate into deeper relationships. Some participants described attending regular or one-off activities where they felt that the type and format of sessions were not helpful for getting to know people. For example, the focus was on a particular activity so chatting was only possible during brief time periods while setting up or packing away. Another barrier was that some participants were more passive than others, and did not initiate conversations or connections themselves. In addition, participants mentioned that the same volunteers or people were often involved in several different groups and activities, resulting in a smaller pool of people to form friendships with. In other instances, it was simply that occasional casual conversations participants had with others did not result in deeper friendships or relationships that were sustained or developed beyond interactions at the events themselves, and individuals, therefore, remained acquaintances.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Opportunities to Improve Connections at a Local Level"}, {"text": "Taken together, these themes demonstrate clear barriers in, and characteristics of, local community connections.

Their mother takes a photograph and sends it with a comment on what they said when they were trying on things.\" (Lynne) The first theme about the role of technology in interviewees' social lives focuses on its use to connect participants with people in geographically distant locations. In fact, many of the digitally mediated interactions described by participants bridged geographical distances. Applications and platforms such as FaceTime, Facebook and WhatsApp (along with traditional landline phone calls) were commonly used to keep in touch with friends and family located in geographically separate locations. Grandchildren were frequently mentioned as being a priority in seeking to connect face-to-face at a distance. While the financial savings of free long-distance technological connection were noted and appreciated by some, interviewees also reflected on the emotional value of being able to stay visually connected with loved ones. For Claire, this connection even changed her perception of the duration of time passing between in-person interactions, making it feel like she had seen her son in person more recently than was the case in reality. In contrast to those using technology to bridge distances in order to maintain existing relationships, Deborah was unusual among interviewees in that she had formed long-lasting friendships with people she met initially through the use of an online marketplace. As someone living alone in later life, she was using technology designed for one purpose (financial/accommodation transactions) to initiate and facilitate face-to-face interactions with strangers from geographically distant locations, offering the potential for developing new social relationships.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Technology and Social Lives"}, {"text": "Our next theme encapsulates the role of technology in connecting family members and groups. Family relationships were frequently discussed as examples of connections that were supported by technology, through informal chatting, sharing photographs or stories and news about day-to-day life events. Family connections using technology ranged from group chats to individual messages, and instant short communications as well as ongoing asynchronous conversations. WhatsApp was often highlighted in this context, particularly for its usefulness in communicating with a group, and across generations. Examples included WhatsApp groups with interviewees, their children and partners, and grandchildren. These were sometimes longstanding groups for general communication, but at other times were set-up for a specific purpose, such as organising a birthday party. Cross-generational interactions were also perceived as improving the connectedness of family members who had previously felt 'left out' of family communications. John described the example of his sister, who was previously less connected with other members of the family but could now see photographs and hear about what other members of the family were doing, without them needing to make a special effort to include her. Technology was seen, in cases like this, as a solution to the barriers to instantaneous communication with family members with diverse and busy lives and routines. However, telephone calls were also important to participants as a way of keeping in touch, particularly with others who were nearer in age such as siblings or friends. In addition, Paul expressed his unease at the invasive nature of commonly used apps and platforms which, for example, access lists of contacts from the device they are using or collect data to support targeted advertising. His use of WhatsApp was 'reluctant' on this basis, but he acknowledged its usefulness in keeping in touch when his son was abroad, highlighting the trade-off he had to negotiate between privacy and connection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Technology and Social Lives"}, {"text": "We did not ask participants explicitly about the ways in which they chose to record social interactions or events, but the use of in-built cameras in mobile phones featured in participants' accounts of the role of technology in their social lives. We have described this theme as 'capturing and sharing images'. The ease of taking photographs with a smartphone in comparison to using a camera was noted by some participants, facilitating them in documenting social occasions. Moreover, despite his privacy concerns about the invasiveness of technology more generally, Paul valued the fact that he was able to recover digital images from an automatic cloud backup after he accidentally deleted photos (documenting an international trip) from his mobile phone. Photographs as mementos of experiences in participants' social lives, like Paul's trip, were treasured. Additionally, the act of sharing and receiving images was a central feature of participants' digital interactions, connecting participants with events and experiences when they were not physically present.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Technology and Social Lives"}, {"text": "After initially dismissing much technology (apart from FaceTime) as insignificant in her social life, Claire later reflected that it did play a large role in how she organised and arranged social events and interactions. The theme of 'sharing information and making arrangements' draws on these organisational uses of technology described by interviewees. Information was generally not necessarily shared on social networking sites or more visible platforms, but interactions commonly took place through instant messaging and other technological channels rather than solely in person. In fact, for Marie, there were additional benefits to using technology as a tool for organising or making arrangements with people. She preferred the control that it gave her in contrast with the unpredictability and social awkwardness she experienced when talking on the phone. Technology was mainly described by interviewees in terms of its role as a tool for connecting, or supporting connections between, people. Conversely, several participants noted the ways in which technology itself was a dimension of their social life, offering an alternative to interactions with people. Perhaps because of its dominant focus on portraying human lives and activities, Jane felt that television was a more 'personal' type of technology. Patricia and Brenda watched television at times when other company or interaction was inaccessible. For Patricia, this was at 'silly hours' of the day or night, whereas Brenda described how she might watch television, DVDs or listen to CDs when she found herself alone or 'down'. There were particular times when others living in her housing development were more likely to be spending time with family, such as weekends, where she used music or television as a strategy to deal with loneliness. At the other end of the spectrum, Simon tended to avoid face-to-face social activities and events with other people, preferring to spend time playing games or reading on his computer.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Technology and Social Lives"}, {"text": "There were two main ways that participants described technology as contributing to disconnection in terms of social interactions and events: its prevalence as a platform for information about events; and its disruptive potential during face-to-face interactions. Sally used the internet but chose not to engage with social media for privacy and security reasons, but felt that this was increasingly disadvantaging her when it came to finding out about local events. She reflected on her reliance on other people to keep her informed, and the difficulties of being separate from the dominant route of information sharing via social media. For Sally, information sharing was happening in a way that excluded her, meaning that she missed out on attending social activities and events that she would have chosen to go to otherwise. In contrast, Liz highlighted the capacity of technology to disrupt social interactions themselves. She described both a friend's extensive use of a smartphone, and purely the presence of a phone (in use or not), as disrupting face-to-face interactions and impacting on their quality. Sally's and Liz's accounts indicated a reluctance to allow technology to become pervasive in everyday life, balanced against a recognition that there were places and circumstances where it could be beneficial.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Technology and Social Lives"}, {"text": "Along with concerns about the potential for technology to disrupt relationships, the positive impacts of technology in participants' social lives were also, in some cases, accompanied by additional unwanted work. Our penultimate theme, therefore, centres around experiences of technological interaction as an additional 'chore'. Sally described being 'bombarded' by messages, and she and others found their perceived continual need to respond and interact electronically to be a burden. The perpetual nature of communicating using interactive technologies such as email, texts and instant messages was also unpopular with some interviewees because of the amount of time it consumed. Responding was not perceived as an optional activity. Even if emails contained welcome content, the task of checking, opening and reading them was viewed as a compulsory individual task and responsibility. Catherine likened this to the responsibility to open letters that came through the post, rather than a choice or pleasurable activity.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Technology and Social Lives"}, {"text": "Our final theme sums up participants' thoughts about not needing digital technologies. More traditional technologies such as the telephone or television were commonly accepted as integral to daily life. In fact, their deep-seated role in participants' social lives meant that they were often no longer considered or mentioned (by participants) when talking about technology. Instead, participants tended to focus on newer digital technologies such as social media, applications and email. Regarding these more modern technologies, there was a sense for some participants that they were unnecessary. For example, when talking about social media, Liz explained that she did not 'think there's a gap that I need them.' Christopher used the internet and email but did not consider it necessary to go online to find out about local social events as he was exposed to paper-based publicity, such as posters and flyers, as well as information via word-of-mouth. For Judith, the whole idea of using a computer or the internet was superfluous when she could instead rely on her family for support, asking them for anything she needed.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Technology and Social Lives"}, {"text": "Overall, technological connections were predominantly bridging distances, with existing local technological connections less obvious. Technology was mainly seen as a tool to be used to make connecting easier where there were needs, barriers or 'gaps' (geographical or generational distances, difficulties sharing information, capturing images, avoiding uncomfortable face-to-face interactions), but not at the expense of disrupting desired face-to-face interactions or in situations where technology was seen as unnecessary (other strategies would suffice).

These included: prioritising engagement within the wider community to develop ideas; connecting different groups with each other; improving provision of information about events and activities in the local area; connecting people with locations and activities in the city centre; and focusing particularly on making use of proximity as a tool in the process of connection.

Participants felt that: there were few local places to socialise; they often did not know their neighbours well; there was an absence of shared community feeling; social activities on offer did not always lead to socialising or making new friends. In a policy and practice environment where technology-based initiatives are increasingly perceived as offering huge potential, our findings highlight the importance of age-friendly approaches that are grounded in the local context [1, 2] . This has become even more apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has exposed the need for digital connection as an alternative to face-to-face interactions. Similarly, finding new ways to connect, including with people in proximate locations, has become even more important in ways we did not anticipate when conducting this study. Every community is unique, so designing to optimise social connectedness at a local level requires understanding and recognition of context-specific characteristics. In addition, taking account of the social and structural particularities of places gives insight into meanings and functions that are the result of cumulative experiences over time [40] . In our study, the geographical layout of the community, restrictions on licensed premises and population churn were all factors that participants highlighted as playing a role in disconnection.

Family connections using technology ranged from group chats to individual messages, and instant short communications as well as ongoing asynchronous conversations. Participants were not necessarily using social networking sites to share information, as Righi et al. [30] also found, but in our study these information-sharing interactions were commonly taking place through instant messaging and other technological channels rather than solely in person. These findings reflect changing levels of digital connection for older people in the UK [28] and emphasise the need for HCI to reconsider longstanding stereotypes of older people as digitally inexperienced or uninterested [13] .

In addition, participants in our study were aware of the potential for technology to contribute to disconnection. Waycott et al.

Participants in this study were comfortable using digital technology to stay in touch with friends and family in geographically distant locations, particularly to maintain close family connections. Kharicha et al. also found that engagement with the outside world by landline telephones and computers was an important strategy adopted by older people experiencing loneliness [43] .

This ranged from using existing green spaces or buildings on a permanent or temporary basis, to creating new spaces and places for social activities and events. A real-life example of creative use of space by older people that challenges expectations and norms was the transformation (for one night only) of a nightclub in Manchester, UK, into a night-time venue reserved for older people [44] . In our study, there were suggestions that spaces could be acquired or managed by groups of local residents as cooperative initiatives. Such work is ongoing in virtual spaces by older people in the UK creating a radio network [45] . Other adaptations to the built environment were also suggested by participants to improve suitability for pedestrians. However, operationalising these ideas and coordinating the input of the local community presents challenges at many levels. While online platforms to facilitate community commissioning of digital services exist [46] , it is not immediately clear that these tools and processes would translate to local community commissioning of resources and events. Moreover, it is unrealistic to expect the required intense interaction with such digital platforms, leading to the need for alternative situated means of participating and engaging in the processes. Given the interest by study participants in leveraging local infrastructures and spaces, it is plausible to consider situated artefacts that would mediate between local, physical, and online engagements. For example, PosterVote is an innovative electronic polling system aiming to provide easy electronic voting for communities [47] . A traditional poster is augmented with buttons that can be pressed by community members to register digital responses to questions on the poster.

In fact, two participants expressed surprise on discovering that they had both been living in the area for many years a few houses apart on adjacent streets, yet they had never interacted before. Concerns about safety, privacy and possible lack of interest by others were mentioned as barriers to interventions at a street level. In recent years, we have witnessed a surge in location-based and serendipitous dating/meet-up services and networks (i.e., Tinder [48] ). The core functionalities of these technologies are the abilities to discover similar individuals in your local area; privately extend an invitation to initiate a conversation; whilst maintaining a degree of privacy and safety through the network's services (not revealing personal details such as address or phone number). Such solutions would have scope to support the hyper-local match-making of friendships within communities. However, our research showed that participants were not using existing online services designed to develop new relationships, indicating that these did not appeal. This is echoed by findings that older people who were lonely did not report using the internet to cultivate new friendships, despite using telephones and computers to engage with the outside world [43] . In fact, one participant, Deborah, had instead capitalised on the ability of an accommodation matching platform to facilitate face-to-face interactions in her home with strangers, who then had the potential to become friends. The opportunity for such encounters (through mutually beneficial financial, or other resource, transactions) to result in long-lasting friendships is an area for further exploration. In particular, it would be interesting to consider how these types of interaction could be translated into a purely local context, given that Deborah's formation of new friendships contrasts with experiences of those in our study who attended regular local activities but did not find them conducive to making friends.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 689, "end": 693, "text": "[48]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1488, "end": 1492, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Focusing on Proximate Connections"}, {"text": "The findings from our study indicate an opportunity for design around community or cooperative ways of addressing local transport gaps. A number of ideas generated by workshop participants related to improving transport in the immediate local area in order to facilitate connection to physical spaces and locations to meet other people. Community or cooperative initiatives were suggested as one option, or mechanism, for driving new models of transport in the area. Volunteer-run minibus and car transport did exist in the local area, but these prioritised 'essential' travel such as hospital appointments and did not have the flexibility that participants thought important. While existing schemes (e.g., StreetBank [49] -a website that facilitates possession sharing and borrowing between neighbours) have been successful in meeting other needs at a very local level, hyper-local journeys in suburban communities outside busy city centres are unlikely to offer sufficient cost/profit ratios to be attractive to existing sharing economy or peer-to-peer services such as Uber. A small number of demand responsive transport (DRT) schemes are running in the UK, and in theory sound promising. However, it is notable that a DRT service actually operated in our study area in the past, but closed in 2011 [50, 51] . Similarly, existing bicycle sharing schemes rely on scale of use within large communities or cities to remain profitable, but in contrast, restricted access to a smaller population might reduce the risk of damage and loss experienced by larger scale operations. Consideration of what a hyper-local transport system might look like would include questions about who might provide and use the service, and what their incentives would be.

[. . . ] It would be a\n</td></tr><tr><td>Connecting across\nGeographically Distant\nLocations\n</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>Connecting Family Members\nand Groups\n</td><td>strange day when I didn't get several WhatsApp messages from other members of the family,\neven if it's only pictures of what they're doing. 'Here's my dinner.' [. . . ] I mean, I\nWhatsApp-ed them all last night when I'd been to the cinema, telling them what I'd seen and\ntelling them to go and see it.\" (Christopher)\n\"I know at Christmas time myself and [son 1] and [daughter] had a group to discuss what we\nwere going to do about [son 2]'s Christmas present. My eldest son has got a little girl, 18 months\nold, and when she was coming up to a year he had a family group to discuss her birthday party.\n[. . . ] So just anything where you want a group of you it's just handy.\" (Catherine)\n\"We WhatsApp people all the time, we're on a WhatsApp group as a family, we've got two, one\nfor just my wife and I and the kids, and one for the wife and I, the kids and my sister. I think\nthat's great, because my sister's becoming more isolated, she's 82 with health problems, so she\nknows what's going on, because she gets the WhatsApps, she gets the pictures. She always\nthought she was being left out until that, and instead of having to ring people round asking\nwhat's happening or tell them about something, you just WhatsApp it.\" (John)\n\"They basically log your life and your habits [. . . ] for targeted advertising for people. [. . . ] So\nit can be quite invasive [. . . ] I reluctantly loaded the WhatsApp thing into my phone because of\n[son's name] going to Singapore, it was handy when he was wanting to check up on one or two\nthings back and forth. [. . . ] As soon as I downloaded it, it read all my contact list. [. . . ] So\nwhen I opened up the WhatsApp app I see all my contacts so it was a bit scary.\" (Paul)\n\"My sister, I talk to her, she lives down in the Midlands. I talk to her every now and then, every\ncouple of weeks or so. Either she rings me, or I ring her.\" (Martin)\nMarie: \"It's got an excellent camera. I use it as a camera because I'm useless at taking\nphotographs otherwise.\"\nSimon: \"See, if Marie uses a camera to take somebody's photograph, and eventually either cuts\nthem in half or chops their head off, you know, which is-But, with this phone, it's absolutely\nbrilliant.\"\nMarie: \"Yes, yes.\"\nSimon: \"The pictures that she's taken when she's been on holiday and things, absolutely\nsuperb.\"\n\"I get loads of photographs of the children when they're opening birthday presents. Their\nmother takes a photograph and sends it with a comment on what they said when they were\ntrying on things.\" (Lynne)\n\"Actually, it is more important than I'm making out because we're always making\narrangements. [. . . ] You have no idea how difficult it is making a weekend arrangement with\npeople who are constantly out of the country. [. . . ] That's another thing that's important, I don't\nknow why I'm even saying it's not important. We do go away quite often, so I do use technology\nto organise where I'm going and what we're doing and what you can do while you're there,\nbasically. So yes, I do use technology quite a lot at that. It's probably very important.\" (Claire)\n\"Because, I'm not very good. If I have to make a phone call to somebody, I'm terrible. If I've got\nto make, like, a cold call to somebody, 'Can you phone so and so to ask them to do this?' I'm\ngoing, 'Do I have to? Do I have to?' [. . . ] and I hate it. I've always hated the telephone for\nmaking phone calls out. Texting is a lifesaver. You can text whenever you want, when you feel\nlike it, and you're not having to speak to somebody and say the wrong thing. So, that's what I\nlike about that technology.\" (Marie)\n</td></tr><tr><td>Capturing and Sharing Images\n</td></tr><tr><td>Sharing Information and\nMaking Arrangements\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}, "TABREF8": {"text": "Table 4.
