An editorial in the Nature Medicine elucidated the challenges for continuing research and sustaining a research career during these difficult times (Ghebreyesus, 2020) . I, being an early career mental health researcher from a developing country, would like to ponder on the ramifications of the pandemic on medical research in general and mental health research in particular.",
