            "text": "Global supply chains are important modern economic coordination routes that connect advanced economy multinational enterprises (AMNEs) with suppliers spread widely across emerging markets (He, Khan, & Shenkar, 2018; Khan, Rao-Nicholson, & Tarba, 2018; Kumaraswamy, Mudambi, Saranga, & Tripathy, 2012 ). Yet, they can also exacerbate the social and environmental sustainability-related governance 1 challenges faced by AMNEs. Beyond representing a moral mandate, sustainability-related governance challenges are incessant in AMNEs' emerging market supply chains and can have profound economic implications, as they can elicit adverse stakeholder reactions, smear reputations, and cause irreversible damage to the financial performance of AMNEs (Czinkota, Kaufmann, & Basile, 2014; Lund--Thomsen & Lindgreen, 2014; Narula, 2019) .",

            "text": "At present, to coordinate, manage, and monitor the sustainability practices of their supplier networks, AMNEs primarily rely on top-down sustainability governance mechanisms such as contracts, social audits, certifications, or codes of conduct (Arora & De, 2020; Huq, Stevenson, & Zorzini, 2014; Van Tulder, Van Wijk, & Kolk, 2009; Yu, 2008 ). However, cross-disciplinary research (e.g., Fung, 2003; Schouten, Leroy, & Glasbergen, 2012; Soundararajan, Brown, & Wicks, 2019) has highlighted the numerous issues that affect these governance mechanisms. First, AMNEs or developed country Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) dominate the process through which such mechanisms are developed and implemented across geographic boundaries-a top-down approach that often undermines the agency and expertise of emerging market suppliers (Rasche, 2012) . Second, the rather rigid sustainability benchmarks imposed by AMNEs are often at odds with the inherently complex, unpredictable, and resource-constrained nature of emerging market supply chains. Third, the AMNEs' existing governance mechanisms disregard the local institutional factors-including culture and socio-economic conditions-that shape the sustainability practices of emerging market suppliers (McWilliam, Kim, Mudambi, & Nielsen, 2020; Narula, 2019; Wilhelm, Blome, Bhakoo, & Paulraj, 2016) . As a result, top-down governance mechanisms carry little legitimacy among emerging market suppliers (Schouten et al., 2012) , as they limit their ability to bring about positive change in global supply chains (Fung, 2003) .",

These alternatives, to which we refer as 'agile sustainability governance (ASG) mechanisms' account for the fact that there is no single universal solution to the sustainability-related governance challenges presented by emerging market supply chains. Instead, ASG mechanisms incorporate diverse perspectives, provide emerging market suppliers with higher degrees of agency, are developed organically, and consider local institutional and market contexts within the governance process called for by scholars (e.g., Fung, 2003; Schouten et al., 2012) . These attributes enable ASG mechanisms to be adaptable and nimble in dealing with the sporadic sustainability-related challenges that may surface in emerging market supply chains (Overdevest & Zeitlin, 2018) . While there are no existing exemplars of ASG mechanisms, the sustainability initiatives enacted by companies such as IKEA (e.g., IWAY initiatives) (see, for example, IKEA (2020)) and Chiquita (e.g., Gender equality initiatives) (see, for example, Chiquita (2020) ) display some of their characteristics.",

            "text": "Although the existing research calls for more research on ASG mechanisms (Moog, Spicer, & B\u00f6hm, 2015; Rasche, 2012) , their development, particularly the process through which AMNEs can develop and enact ASG mechanisms for emerging market supply chains, has received surprisingly little attention. Drawing on insights from experimentalist governance theory (Overdevest & Zeitlin, 2018; Sabel & Zeitlin, 2008 and deliberation theory (Booher & Innes, 2002; Dryzek, 2009; Fung, 2003; Isaacs, 2008) , we propose an iterative processual framework comprising four-stages-namely, collective definition, autonomous execution, evaluation, and collective redefinition, that we suggest is well-suited to the development of ASG mechanisms for emerging market supply chains. Notably, this type of processual conceptualization is rarely found within the broader governance and sustainability literature. We further highlight the challenges to supplier participation that can emerge during the process, and we discuss the relational and resource factors that facilitate the establishment of an authentic dialogue between AMNEs and their emerging market suppliers--an essential component of the four-stage process. We contend that ASG mechanisms have the potential to open new pathways for the improvement of sustainability; pathways that are simultaneously defined by top-down as well as bottom-up approaches (e.g., Bos & Brown, 2012; Sabel & Zeitlin, 2012) . This paper makes three critical theoretical contributions. First, although current research on transnational sustainability governance mechanisms broadly highlights some of the characteristics and the significance of what we refer to as ASG mechanisms, it has hitherto paid scant attention to their development (e.g., Hage, Leroy, & Petersen, 2010; Mena & Palazzo, 2012; Moog et al., 2015; Soundararajan et al., 2019) . Our processual framework brings together different facets and enablers of the development of ASG mechanisms that go beyond mere deliberation, thereby contributing to research on transnational sustainability governance (Kolk, 2016; Shapiro, Hobdari, & Oh, 2018; Soundararajan & Brown, 2016; Vurro, Russo, & Perrini, 2009) . We contend that deliberation is only one part of the ASG puzzle. Second, the literature on transnational sustainability governance has predominantly focused on the role played by top-down governance mechanisms (Arora & De, 2020; Huq et al., 2014; Van Tulder et al., 2009; Yu, 2008) . This paper highlights the need to move towards a mixture of top-down and bottom-up governance suited to better deal with rapidly and sporadically changing market conditions-such as those brought about by trade wars, protectionist policies, and large scale disruptions (e.g., COV-ID-19)-that can have profound impacts on global supply chains (Petricevic & Teece, 2019; Verbeke, 2020; Witt, 2019) . As a by-product, this paper also makes an applied contribution by highlighting the process and conditions involved in the enactment of agile governance systems that bring together top-down and bottom-up governance architectures. Third, this paper extends the literature on strategic agility (Doz & Kosonen, 2010; Goldman, Nagel, & Preiss, 1995; Weber & Tarba, 2014) within emerging markets (Boojihawon, Richeri, Liu, & Chicksand, 2020; Fourn\u00e9, Jansen, & Mom, 2014) by introducing the concept of agile governance in the context of sustainability practices. Beyond improving the sustainability practices of their emerging market suppliers, ASG mechanisms can enable AMNEs to gain strategic agility--the ability to adapt to constantly changing and uncertain environments (Goldman et al., 1995; Junni, Sarala, Tarba, & Weber, 2015; Teece, Peteraf, & Leih, 2016) , which is of particular relevance in emerging market contexts, where AMNEs are more likely to encounter more significant levels of uncertainty than in advanced economies. In this regard, our concept of agile governance has broader implications for the international business literature.",

First, we present the literature on sustainability governance in emerging market supply chains, strategic agility, and experimentalist governance and deliberation theories. Then, we highlight the importance of the agile governance of sustainability practices in emerging market supply chains. Subsequently, drawing from experimentalist governance theory and deliberation theory, we develop a processual framework of agile sustainability governance mechanisms and illustrate the core conditions for its implementation. Finally, we articulate the theoretical and practical implications of ASG mechanisms and offer recommendations for future research on the topic.",

Traditionally, to address the governance challenges imposed by emerging market supply chains, AMNEs have used contractual mechanisms (Bird & Soundararajan, 2020 ) that govern relationships through formal agreements that determine modes of interactions and remedies, for breaches and unexpected events (Poppo & Zenger, 2002) . While such mechanisms can be useful in addressing operational challenges, they are ineffective in addressing the sustainability-related governance issues that arise in emerging market supply chains (Bird & Soundararajan, 2020) , as such issues cannot be controlled and coordinated with the same ease with which formal contracts usually deal with quality, quantity, price, time, and other operational problems (Wilhelm et al., 2016) . Any shortfalls of the universally acknowledged scientific benchmarks against which AMNEs measure their suppliers' sustainability practices create further impediments in the process. Moreover, AMNEs generally cannot directly monitor the everyday activities of their suppliers due to geographic distances and institutional (e.g., cultural and regulatory) differences (Huq et al., 2014) . Besides, due to infrastructural deficiencies and, in some instances, political and economic instability, the governance of emerging market supply chains presents particular challenges to AMNEs (Xu & Shenkar, 2002) .",

Those AMNEs that do not engage in any demonstrable effort towards the adoption of sustainable practices are widely condemned (Wettstein, Giuliani, Santangelo, & Stahl, 2019) . Although several emerging markets have adopted stringent standards and regulations, their enforcement is weak due to the prevalence of corruption and poor regulatory infrastructure (Javorcik & Wei, 2009; Witt et al., 2017) , which makes it difficult for AMNEs to rely on their suppliers' local regulatory environments. To resolve this impasse, AMNEs increasingly rely on social audits (Locke, Amengual, & Mangla, 2009) , which are assessments performed-either by the AMNEs themselves or by third-party auditors on their behalf-to measure and report on the sustainability practices of their suppliers. Conducted against a set of benchmarks developed by the AMNEs themselves and/or by third parties (such as NGOs), or through multi-stakeholder collaboration, social audits help in communicating legitimate information on the sustainability practices adopted across an AMNE's supply chain to its concerned stakeholders. AMNEs also use these assessments to identify and establish relationships with distant suppliers and monitor and incentivize their behaviors (Mueller, Dos Santos, & Seuring, 2009 ).",

For instance, Mena and Palazzo (2012) drew on deliberation theory to highlight the lack of input and output legitimacy of social audit mechanisms. Input legitimacy-which is evaluated through inclusion, procedural fairness, consensual orientation, and transparency-refers to \"rule credibility, or the extent to which the regulations are perceived as justified\", while output legitimacy-which is evaluated through coverage, efficacy, and enforcement-refers to \"rule effectiveness, or the extent to which the rules effectively solve the issues\" (Mena & Palazzo, 2012: 527) . Soundararajan et al. (2019) drew on stakeholder theory and deliberation theory to emphasize the failures of supply chain governance in terms of \"the postures or orientations of participants involved in multi-stakeholder initiatives (MSIs) towards each other, and the processes used among participants to engage in the creation of MSIs and to sustain them over time\" (p. 387). Specifically, they discussed the limitations of social audit mechanisms in terms of their inclusiveness (of participants and discourses), authenticity (of deliberations), and consequentiality (of social audit mechanisms).",

These evasion practices include bribing government authorities for documents, operating unregistered production facilities, prepping workers for audits, and terminating troublesome workers before inspections; all activities that are likely to increase supply chain sustainability risks for AMNEs (Lee, Plambeck, & Yatsko, 2012) , triggering further audits and negatively affecting the degree of mutual trust they enjoy with their suppliers. Such a pattern reinforces a negative feedback loop, ultimately reducing overall sustainability performance (Tachizawa & Wong, 2015) .",

First, they need to be emergent and adaptive to accommodate the complexities and changes that affect emerging market supply chains (Huq et al., 2014) . Second, they must be able to bring together and balance the diverging interests of AMNEs and their diverse suppliers, who are connected through complex networks characterized by asymmetries in power, knowledge, and information (Rasche, 2012) . Third, they must possess the capacity to initiate a dialogue process suited to harmonize diverging interests and to break down any barriers created by rigid predetermined structural positions (Soundararajan et al., 2019) . Last, they must facilitate sustainable solutions that are creative, innovative, and mutually beneficial for both the AMNEs and their emerging market suppliers (Mena & Palazzo, 2012) . In other words, the existing studies indirectly call for agile sustainability governance mechanisms to be implemented in emerging market supply chains.",

This concept directs attention to a firm's ability to nimbly capture strategic opportunities (Kotter, 2014) through the flexible adaptation and reconfiguration of business models (Doz & Kosonen, 2010) . Accordingly, strategic agility has been embraced by different functional areas of management-such as information technology, human resource management, supply chain and production (Doz, 2020; Sambamurthy, Bharadwaj, & Grover, 2003; Shams, Vrontis, Belyaeva, Ferraris, & Czinkota, 2020 )-and has been applied in multiple contexts such as business model renewal (Doz & Kosonen, 2010; Teece et al., 2016) , digital transformation (Warner & W\u00e4ger, 2019) , the governance of international joint ventures (Debellis, De Massis, Petruzzelli, Frattini, & Del Giudice, 2020) , and acquisition processes (Junni et al., 2015) . Doz and Kosonen (2010) highlighted the importance of three meta-capabilities of strategic agility-namely, strategic sensitivity, leadership unity, and resource fluidity. Strategic sensitivity indicates the ability to understand and respond to environmental changes; leadership unity refers to aspects like managerial responsiveness and a unified commitment to change; and resource fluidity discusses the ability to restructure and reconfigure knowledge, resources, and capabilities to adapt rapidly.",

            "text": "According to experimentalist governance theory, governance \"is a recursive process of provisional goal setting and revision based on learning from [a] comparison of alternative approaches to advancing these goals in different contexts\" (Overdevest & Zeitlin, 2018: 25) . The core constructs of this theory are autonomy, consultation, and reiteration. Autonomy recognizes the agency of implementing actors, consultation emphasizes their perspectives, and reiteration refers to the emergent nature of governance relevant to contexts and issues. These constructs date back to the writings of pragmatists such as Dewey (1927) , who argued that governance mechanisms must be flexible and evolving-as opposed to conventional and fixed-instruments. Such mechanisms should be developed in collaboration with the implementing actors to address a social issue at the local level, and their processes and outcomes should be periodically monitored. Moreover, the feedback obtained from such periodical monitoring should be used to enable the further adjustment and development of the governance mechanisms, making them flexible, responsive, and adaptable to the local contexts in which their actual implementation takes place (Overdevest & Zeitlin, 2018). Overdevest and Zeitlin (2018) decoded these basic features of experimentalist governance theory into four processes iteratively linked together. The first involves the setting up of benchmarks based on multi-stakeholder deliberation, which is defined as \"debate and discussion aimed at producing reasonable, well-informed opinions in which participants are willing to revise preferences in light of the discussion, new information and claims\" (Chambers, 2003: 309) and differs from other forms of talks-such as bargaining-as it enables individuals to discuss, analyze, and decide whether a particular act of bargaining is fair and appropriate (Remer, 2000) . The second process involves allowing those who are governed to meet these set benchmarks in their own ways, albeit within the boundaries of ethical guidelines. The third involves performance reports, peer-to-peer learning, and the adoption of corrective measures. The fourth process involves the revision of the benchmarks and procedures based on multi-stakeholder deliberations. When these four processes are iterated cyclically, the outcome will be an agile governance mechanism endowed with ample flexibility and legitimacy and suited to effectively govern any complex issues as they emerge (Overdevest & Zeitlin, 2018) .",

However, the differences in power, culture, resources, and institutions inherent to global supply chains can challenge the realization of a deliberative system, leading to a breakdown in its governance. In this vein, collective stakeholder orientation becomes important (Soundararajan et al., 2019) . This construct reflects the importance of the involvement of supply chain participants, serving their interests, and building relationships with them aimed at generating overlapping value and shared responsibility.

Also, they collectively learn to use various methods and mechanisms that facilitate bringing actors together when governance problems arise (Herriot & Pemberton, 1995) . Through such collective learning 2 , actors acquire emancipatory knowledge 3 (Habermas, 1981 (Habermas, , 1985 that enables them to recognize the value they can create by visualizing governance issues in new and different ways. Over time, collective learning, in itself, can also become a reason for these actors to engage in the process (Sabel & Zeitlin, 2010) . Powerful actors, such as AMNEs, would become less likely to use power differentials to seek additional rents or to establish relationships that some might consider exploitative (Soundararajan et al., 2019) , and would also become more likely to seek the views of others, while ensuring that the terms and solutions of any issues are understood and accepted by the other actors, rather than imposed upon them. This, in turn, may convince powerful actors to change their perspectives and recognize the importance of the 'local knowledge' (Geertz, 2008 ) that actors such as emerging market suppliers can bring to the table (De B\u00farca, Keohane, & Sabel, 2014) . (Capello, 1999, p. 354) . 3 Emancipatory knowledge is knowledge that surpasses the psychological, situational and institutional barriers created by societies (Habermas, 1981) , and is critical to disrupt the status quo and to keep up with the changes in a rapidly transforming and increasingly complex and unpredictable world (Habermas, 1981) .",

First, AMNEs and their suppliers must make sincere statements; i.e., they must candidly express their honest thoughts and options. Second, the statements made or knowledge shared by AMNEs and their suppliers must be accurate, as the claims made by one actor can only be tested by others and experts if they are accurate. Any inaccurate, prejudiced, inappropriate, and self-centered information sabotages the entire dialogue process, causing a stalemate and preventing the search for suitable solutions. Third, while bearing in mind that comprehensibility is \"often a moving target as ideas and understandings change, and it has to be constantly checked within the group\" (Innes & Booher, 2010: 98) , AMNEs and their suppliers must make statements that are clear and mutually comprehensible, as any incomprehensible information is unusable. Fourth, in those cases in which not all actors can be present at the deliberation process, legitimately appointed representatives need to be allowed to speak on their behalf. This enables all actors to truly interact with each other and offer sincere assurances. Finally, authentic dialogue requires AMNEs and their suppliers to listen to each other, as listening creates a space for the inclusion of the discourses of marginalized and neglected actors in a dialogue process dominated by an 'enlightened metanarrative' (Innes, 2004) , and is fundamental to understanding the situations and problems of others. The positive aspect of listening is that actors can retain their viewpoints in the background while listening to the circumstances of others in the foreground (Innes & Booher, 2010) , which creates awareness of dissensions and reveals their underlying reasons. This, however, does not imply the accumulation of all voices in a search for the lowest common denominator (Karl, Susskind, & Wallace, 2007) ; rather, it involves authentic listening aimed at recognizing how one can benefit from interacting with others.",

Suppliers perceive that their voices are being heard and included and, in turn, accept the benchmarks and 'buy into' the process. To summarize, sustainability benchmarks collectively developed on the basis of an authentic dialogue acquire all the features that are needed to gain procedural legitimacy among emerging market suppliers and other involved actors. For example, improving the condition of women in emerging market supply chains is a challenge faced by several AMNEs. Chiquita, a leading producer and distributor of bananas in the United States, developed benchmarks to promote a safe work environment for women workers by engaging in an authentic dialogue with banana producers and other stakeholders in Central and South America. The inclusivity and authenticity of these benchmarks, which were defined collectively, led to them being recognized by the World Banana Forum (WBF), and local and international unions.",

Research suggests that most are small and medium-sized firms (Humphrey & Schmitz, 2000; Soundararajan et al., 2018) of an entrepreneurial nature unaccustomed to formalized and structured processes. The primary issue that negatively affects the current sustainability governance mechanisms is that the governing actors, such as AMNEs, require their suppliers to follow a universal process to meet the set benchmarks, even when the latter are collectively deliberated. The uniqueness and differentiating features of suppliers are suppressed in the interest of consistency and control.

This notion of realizing the agency of emerging market suppliers has been the subject of studies in other disciplines (e.g., Schouten & Bitzer, 2015) , which have argued against the idea of emerging market suppliers being mere rule takers. While the previous stage ensures that the voices of suppliers are included in the development of sustainability benchmarks, the present one guarantees that they are allowed to exercise their agency in fulfilling those benchmarks. Appreciating the agency of those who are being governed is one of the core foundations of experimentalist governance theory (Heilmann et al., 2013) . In this stage, which is where actual experiments occur in the governance space, suppliers attempt to find implementation pathways and processes that suit their interests, resources, contexts, and capabilities. Their perceptions of freedom motivate them to take risks and develop innovative solutions tailored to their local settings. This is captured well in the case of Chiquita, in which, to meet the set benchmarks-i.e., to ensure a working environment that is safe and free from discrimination for women workers-small scale producers, in collaboration with stakeholders such as unions and WBF, developed localized solutions such as women's committees and training modules.",

It also includes procedures for monitoring, resolving conflict, and sanctioning any defaulters during implementation. A third-party auditor usually inspects emerging market suppliers against a pre-established benchmark developed without supplier involvement. Based on such evaluations, suppliers are warned, penalized, or removed from trade relationships. Existing governance mechanisms view tick-box compliance as an end. Moreover, although suppliers invest resources into complying with the requirements, the value they receive in return is much lower than that accrued by AMNEs. As a result, suppliers harbor perceptions of distributional unfairness in their transactions with AMNEs.",

The idea of 'applicability' is the most crucial attribute of experimentalist governance theory; it differentiates it from mechanistic monolithic systems, which take functional, methodic, and procedural approaches to problem-solving. Applicability is the outcome of numerous interlocked parallel micro-level interactions-enacted between suppliers, AMNEs, and other actors-that ensure that even minor concerns are recorded and acted upon. Another consequence of such interactions is that they establish spontaneous self-organized communities, giving rise to some forms of systematic and consistent patterns grounded in a few simple rules that could not have been anticipated by the distinct actions of supply chain actors. Such self-organization helps in establishing the agility of the entire governance system. Second, the periodic redefinition of benchmarks enables the mechanisms to gain higher levels of legitimacy among the participating actors, especially among emerging market suppliers. This increases supplier trust both in the sustainability governance mechanisms and in the governing actors (i.e., AMNEs), which leads to better relationships and improved implementation. This increase in trust and the development of patterns of self-organization can result in AMNEs making relation-specific investments aimed at supporting suppliers in complying with the benchmarks (Bird & Soundararajan, 2020) . These relation-specific investments strengthen the bonds and increase the dependency between actors, automatically motivating both AMNEs and emerging market suppliers to safeguard their relationships and investments.",

For example, continuous improvement is one of Chiquita's sustainability policies, for which they work closely with their producers and unions. This helps in identifying any challenges during the implementation of the established benchmarks and updating them accordingly. This process ensures that governance mechanisms are relevant and robust, and thus suited to address any incipient sustainability issues in emerging market supply chains. While the participation of emerging market suppliers in the aforementioned four-stage process would help in the development of ASG mechanisms, some key challenges could arise during this process.

In terms of institutional conditions, emerging markets are characterized by institutional voids (Khanna & Palepu, 2000) that obstruct suppliers from participating in the process of governance by thwarting the efficient functioning of markets, increasing transaction costs, and weakening governance structures (Mair & Marti, 2009 ). To navigate in and around such institutional voids, resource-constrained suppliers regularly engage in bricolage-defined as \"making do by applying combinations of the resources at hand to new problems and opportunities\" (Baker and Nelson (2005) : 333)-which, in turn, consumes time and resources. Corruption can be another daunting challenge for supplier participation that is more highly pertinent in emerging countries than in advanced economies (World Bank, 2018) . For resource-deprived suppliers, operating in corrupt contexts can prove expensive (Narula, 2019) and lead to a reduction in the resources needed to take part in the iterative agile governance process. Furthermore, only select AMNEs and their emerging-market suppliers are likely participants in the ASG process. This can disturb the standardized practices of sustainability compliance in the suppliers' context, causing rifts between participants and non-participants in the process.",

While an authentic dialogue brings these issues to the fore, a collective stakeholder orientation can drive AMNEs to share responsibility and invest in developing supplier capabilities.

Recently, however, the focus has increasingly shifted to understanding the positive consequences of diversity (Page, 2008) . While the term 'diversity' typically refers to identity-based differences linked to age, gender, ethnicity, and other cultural and demographical aspects, we use it in reference to cognition-based functional ones. Functional diversity can be defined as \"differences in how people represent problems and how they go about solving them\" (Hong & Page, 2004: 16385) . Although the identityand cognition-based forms of diversity differ conceptually, there is ample evidence proving a connection between the two (Page, 2007) . The ways in which actors view problems and find solutions are driven by their values, interests, training, life experience, and culture. Consistent with the increase in diversity within workforces and inter-and intra-organizational teams, a considerable amount of empirical literature concurs that functionally diverse groups perform better than homogenous or less diverse ones (Hong & Page, 2004; Page, 2007) . This deduction stems from two important features of functional diversity-namely, perspective and heuristics (Page, 2007) . Perspective refers to the \"representation of the set of the possible\" (Page, 2007: 7) . Individuals possess different perspectives when their mental representations of 'the set of the possible' differ. For example, while one individual may arrange files in a computer folder by name, another may arrange them by date. Such mental representations of the 'set of the possible' define the order in which items (of any kind) are arranged. Such order governs how individuals go about finding solutions; therefore, different individuals view the same problem from different perspectives and find different solutions. Pooling these perspectives increases the prospect of finding creative and innovative solutions (Randel & Jaussi, 2003) .",

The actors always set out with different perspectives on a problem. During stages one to four, they continuously challenge the status quo or problematize the traditional assumptions behind ideas and knowledge. In a supply chain, the sharing of such processes forces the actors to develop a more nuanced and multifaceted understanding of a problem, albeit from different perspectives. This process enables them to collaboratively construct a shared understanding of a problem in terms of its technical characteristics and institutional dimensions (Susskind & Cruikshank, 1987) . Often, with such an understanding comes the realization of the benefits of collaborative decisions and actions. Of course, AMNEs and their suppliers will not engage in such collaborative activities if they do not foresee any benefits. However, the very idea that an exit is always an option maintains the tension between them and motivates them to identify mutually beneficial solutions.",

First, communication serves the function of creating channels for an effective and transparent dialogue between the actors in the process. Authentic dialogue can work effectively when the actors have access to accurate information about the processes and other actors involved (Innes & Booher, 2010) . While face-to-face communication reduces the distortion of meanings, it is not always feasible when actors are geographically and culturally distant, as in the case of AMNEs and their emerging market suppliers (Lancioni, Smith, & Oliva, 2000) . In such instances, investing in infrastructure can enable face-to-face communication (e.g., through digital means). Additionally, speaking a common language leads to effective communication (Carpini, Cook, & Jacobs, 2004) . In the extremely challenging multi-lingual network scenarios of global supply chains, the provision of a professional multi-lingual translation service can ensure that the meanings are not distorted.",

Given the institutional, cultural, and ideological differences that characterize such chains, calls to examine the governance issues found in them have become increasingly common (Kano et al., 2020; McWilliam et al., 2020) . In this paper, we propose a process through which an AMNE and its emerging market supply chain partners can develop ASG mechanisms. Drawing on insights from experimentalist governance and deliberation theories, this paper puts forward four iterative stages that combine to form the development process of ASG mechanisms-namely, collective definition, autonomous execution, evaluation, and collective redefinition. Next, we identify and discuss three sources from which challenges that can hinder the participation of emerging market suppliers in developing ASG mechanisms can arise-namely, institutional conditions, supplier capabilities, and cost structures. We further argue that an authentic dialogue is crucial to the development of agile governance mechanisms and highlight the importance of relational and resource factors in enabling their effective functioning.",

Grounding the process in an authentic dialogue enables the development of tightly connected formal and informal relationships rooted in trust and social ties between an AMNE and its suppliers. Such social capital facilitates a less hostile negotiation and a more generous sharing of knowledge among partners (Benito, Petersen, & Welch, 2019) . For instance, this could enable (1) an effective joint search for the knowledge needed to solve any emergent and complex sustainability problems in emerging market supply chains, and (2) the development and sharing of intellectual capital through the collective understanding of interests, values, issues, measures, methods, and potential solutions (Torres de Oliveira et al., 2020) .",

For an agreement to obtain legitimacy-regardless of whether it is revolutionary or a panacea-it must be the result of an impartial, inclusive, and responsible process (Innes, 1998) . Regulative institutions or socio-cultural traditions may influence the process, but should neither structure nor define it. The very survival of the process thus depends on its legitimacy. The exclusion of specific interests or the omission of vital facts or other facets of a legitimate process diminishes its credibility, and hinders the search for feasible and legitimate solutions. On the contrary, the outcomes of a legitimate process may be supported even by those participants whose interests and expectations are not fully met. This is because a legitimate process makes actors perceive that their perspectives are considered, and their voices are heard (Mena & Palazzo, 2012) .",

While some actors may view such bundle-or parts thereof-as a positive outcome, others may consider it a negative one.

Nevertheless, the development of such governance mechanisms has surprisingly received very little attention. Within this domain, while the deliberation aspect embedded within the development of ASG mechanisms-which has received attention-is important, it represents only one of the components in this process. By cross-fertilizing knowledge from experimentalist governance (Overdevest & Zeitlin, 2018; Sabel & Zeitlin, 2012; Sabel & Zeitlin, 2008) and deliberation theories (Booher & Innes, 2002; Dryzek, 2009; Fung, 2003; Isaacs, 2008) , we present a detailed framework that explains different facets of the development process as well as factors that may challenge and enable it.",

The importance of bottom-up sustainability governance has been highlighted as an alternative, especially in the context of emerging market suppliers (Soundararajan et al., 2019) . Although there is value in bottom-up governance mechanisms, AMNEs do not uncouple from controlling and coordinating their supply chains. Indeed, ASG mechanisms lie somewhere in between top-down and bottom-up governance wherein they allow AMNEs to be involved in the establishment of sustainability benchmarks and the evaluation of suppliers, while simultaneously bestowing autonomy on suppliers through their involvement in the development and implementation of benchmarks in localized contexts. We argue that such governance mechanisms are especially crucial for AMNEs to effectively and efficiently govern their emerging market supply chains, which are often characterized by turbulent contexts. We explored how an iterative and inclusive approach to sustainability governance that is more adaptive to rapidly changing market conditions can be so developed.",

In the emerging market context, firm strategic agility is observed to be particularly beneficial in adapting to uncertain and rapidly changing environments (Boojihawon et al., 2020; Bouguerra et al., 2019; Junni et al., 2015; Weber & Tarba, 2014) . However, the focus of this literature has primarily been on firms developing strategic agility to respond dynamically to changes in the external environment (cf. Pereira et al., 2020) . We argue for the need to explore agility, from a governance perspective, in the relationships between AMNEs and their emerging market suppliers, which are characterized by high levels of information and power asymmetry, especially concerning the governance of sustainability practices. In an era of declining multilateralism and supply chain disruption events like the COVID-19 pandemic, AMNEs will need to rely more on relational factors in governing their supply chains, as their emerging market suppliers might have better access to information about the economic characteristics of the particular locale (Verbeke, 2020) . The current literature on international business and strategy provides limited insights on how agile governance functions in supply networks led and coordinated by AMNEs (e.g., McWilliam et al., 2020; Strange & Humphrey, 2019) . Our framework extends the strategic agility literature by highlighting the relevance of agility in network relationships, particularly in the governance of such relationships in uncertain and rapidly changing environments such as emerging markets. In engaging with emerging market suppliers, AMNEs need to endure formal institutional voids and incremental pro-market reforms (Cuervo-Cazurra, Gaur, & Singh, 2019; Sahasranamam & Ball, 2018) , deal with differences in institutional contexts, supplier capabilities, and cost structures, and handle varying supplier expectations (Hansen et al., 2016; Torres de Oliveira et al., 2020) . In the face of such unpredictable environments, we argue that agility in governance practices can help AMNEs to dynamically adapt to changes.",

First, it provides AMNEs with a practical framework suited to approach sustainability governance in emerging market supply chains. Second, the use of an agile approach enables AMNEs to consider uncertainty, as an inherent characteristic of emerging markets, within the development process itself. Emerging market suppliers are increasingly subjected to coercive and normative pressure to meet sustainability demands (e.g., the mandatory CSR provision in India's Companies Act 2013) (Jain, Aguilera, & Jamali, 2017; Sahasranamam, Arya, & Sud, 2019) . Also, emerging markets are going through multiple phases of institutional reform (Cuervo-Cazurra et al., 2019) . The use of agile governance mechanisms would help to iteratively introduce incremental responses to environmental changes at a cost lower than that of top-down governance approaches.",

            "text": "Our agile sustainability governance mechanism model offers scope for multiple future research opportunities. First, scholars could empirically test our framework across various supply chains operating in different emerging markets. This would be particularly relevant for those countries and contexts that are susceptible to labor and environmental violations despite the presence of top-down governance mechanisms. Further testing the boundary conditions of these agile governance mechanisms would also be useful. Second, while we highlight some critical challenges to supplier participation in the development process of ASG, further research is needed to more deeply understand these and other difficulties that could emerge in dynamic contexts. Third, future studies could draw insights from the dynamic capability perspective and institutional theory to compare agile and topdown governance mechanisms. Such studies could investigate specific buyer-supplier networks and examine how these two kinds of governance mechanisms enable or constrain the sustainability outcomes in supply chains and the conditions under which each mechanism is likely to have a more significant impact on sustainability practices. Fourth, there is also scope for future studies to examine the role played by ASG mechanisms in the economic upgrading of emerging market suppliers. Whether and how such mechanisms can enable suppliers to move up the value chain are essential questions that warrant more considerable attention. Fifth, future studies could pay greater attention to the issues of time and context and explore the conditions under which ASG mechanisms are effective across inter-and intra-organizational settings. Relatedly, it would be fruitful to examine how these mechanisms evolve and change the relationship between suppliers and their lead firms (AMNEs). Sixth, future research could use the context of supply chain disrupting events like COVID-19 to test our ASG mechanisms against the backdrop of such exogenous shocks in order to identify boundary conditions and other enablers. Lastly, in emerging market supply chains, managerial decision-making is often concentrated in the hands of owners, business groups, or family members; therefore, it would be particularly beneficial to draw on the micro-foundations lens of global strategy (Contractor, Foss, Kundu, & Lahiri, 2019) to understand the heuristics and managerial decision logics of suppliers in relation to their involvement in ASG mechanisms.",

Existing governance mechanisms are essentially top-down in nature and are often viewed as mere box-ticking exercises, severely limiting their usefulness in the uncertain and complex context of emerging markets. On the other hand, bottom-up governance mechanisms, although valuable, are not fully recognized by AMNEs. With this in mind, we offer a processual framework that brings together the top-down and bottom-up governance architectures towards the development of agile sustainability governance mechanisms for emerging market supply chains. By unraveling supplier-related challenges, and the resource and relational conditions that assist in collectively developing ASG mechanisms that are responsive to local institutional settings and diverse interests, this paper is among the earliest to highlight the relevance of ASG mechanisms in the coordination of emerging market supply chains. Using our framework, AMNEs can effectively and benevolently govern sustainability in their emerging market supply chains and respond to the needs of various stakeholders. We maintain that such a governance structure will become increasingly important against the backdrop of a post-COVID-19 global order.",
