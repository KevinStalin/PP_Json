The first dose was administered at a median time of 4 (IQR 3 -5) 172 days from inpatient admission. The median time to censoring date was 13 (IQR 10-17) 173 and 8 (IQR 5-10) days for tocilizumab and control groups, respectively. The 174 distribution of patient's characteristics as well as mortality and ICU admission rates 175 according to the use of tocilizumab is shown in Table 1. Compared to the control 176 group, there was a higher frequency of men and previous lung disease in the 177 tocilizumab group while controls were significantly older and had a higher prevalence 178 of diabetes. As expected, there were small differences between both groups in some of 179 the baseline vital signs and laboratory parameters that were indicative of greater 180 disease severity in the tocilizumab group than in the control group. 181 182 Primary and secondary endpoints 183 The 1,229 subjects accounted for 11,900 observations, and the crude incidence rate of 184 death was 17.8 (95% CI, 13.8 -22.8) per 1000 persons-days in the tocilizumab group 185 vs. 16.6 (95% CI, 13.9 -19.8) per 1000 persons-days in the control group. In the 186 unadjusted analysis (logistic regression analysis with no covariates entered into the 187 model), tocilizumab was associated with a higher risk of death (in the adjusted analyses in which we found a significant interaction 190 between tocilizumab use and CRP values (p=0.023 and p=0.012 for primary and 191 secondary endpoints, respectively). Patients who received tocilizumab and had baseline 192 CRP levels above 150 mg/L experienced lower rates of death (aHR 0.34, 95% CI 0.17 193 -0.71, p=0.005) and ICU admission/death (aHR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 -0.80, p=0.011) 194 than those who did not receive tocilizumab.

The estimates of the effect of tocilizumab among subjects with 209 baseline CRP >150 mg/L who received these concomitant treatments were very 210 similar to those observed in the principal analyses for both the primary and secondary outcomes (all p-values <0.05 except azithromycin and lopinavir/ritonavir, with 212 p=0.105 in the primary and p=0.079 in the secondary outcome, respectively). 213 214 Discussion 215While the overall risk of death or ICU admission did not differ among patients who 216 received tocilizumab to those who did not and had CRP levels \u2264150 mg/L, we found a 217 66% reduction in the risk of mortality in patients with baseline CRP levels >150 mg/L 218 who received tocilizumab. Exploratory sensitivity analyses to account for the use of219 concomitant therapies against SARS-CoV-2 or the presence of other analytical 220 parameters predictive of poor prognosis yielded consistent treatment effect estimates. 221 Early reports suggest that systemic inhibition of IL-6 signaling is beneficial in the 222 treatment of severe COVID-19.[7,22,23] The original observational study of 21 223 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan reported that tocilizumab resulted in resolution of 224 fever in all patients one day after treatment and improvement of peripheral oxygen 225 saturation and lymphopenia. Moreover, 19 of 20 patients who received tocilizumab 226 presented a radiological improvement in the CT scan after 5 days.[10] In a single-arm 227 study of 63 patients with a pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state due to severe 228 COVID-19, treatment with tocilizumab was associated with a decrease in CRP, D-229 dimer, and ferritin levels.[9] Thus, tocilizumab and other repurposed medications 230 have been widely used off-label to treat COVID-19 in an attempt to mitigate the 231 dramatic clinical consequences of SARS-Cov-2 infection, despite the lack of robust 232 information on the effects of tocilizumab on clinical outcomes. Recent press releases of 233 clinical trials with anti-IL-6 agents (sarilumab and tocilizumab) have reported that 234 these drugs have not met their endpoints, although studies are still being conducted in 235 different treatment settings. [24,25] In our cohort, controls were significantly older and had a higher prevalence of 237 hypertension, which are the risk factors that have been more robustly associated with 238 severe COVID-19 and death.[6,20,26,27] However, subjects who received 239 tocilizumab tended to have a greater prevalence of other potential risk factors for 240 disease severity such as previous lung disease, as well as differences in baseline vital 241 signs and laboratory parameters indicative of greater immune activation. All of these 242 factors were included as covariates, and the estimates were consistent across the two 243 endpoints analyzed. 244 The selection of the modeling strategy was a critical decision. Longitudinal studies in 245 which exposures, confounders, and outcomes are measured repeatedly over time can 246 facilitate causal inferences about the effects of exposure on outcome.[19] However, 247 there are key analytical issues in this setting, including the risk of immortal time bias 248 (i.e., the requirement for patients to survive long enough to receive the intervention of 249 interest, which can lead to a potentially incorrect estimation of a positive treatment 250 effect), and indication bias from time-varying confounding (e.g., the use of tocilizumab 251 following elevations of CRP).[19,28] Standard regression models for the analysis of 252 cohort studies with time-updated measurements may result in biased estimates of 253 treatment effects if time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment are 254 present.[19,29] Marginal structural models, similarly to the time-dependent Cox 255 proportional hazards models, are a powerful method of controlling for confounding in 256 longitudinal study designs that collect time-varying information on exposure, 257 outcome, and other covariates, such as the present one.[18,19] These models aim to 258 appropriately control for the effects of time-varying confounders that are affected by 259 prior treatment (exposure), and attempt to enhance group comparability and estimate 260 causal effects in a similar way. [29]Our study has a number of limitations. As with any observational study, there is still a 262 risk of unmeasured confounding, as well as indication and immortal time biases, 263 despite having focused the methodology on avoiding them. Tocilizumab targets the 264 IL-6 receptor, and thus using baseline IL-6 levels instead of CRP in the interaction 265 term with tocilizumab use could have helped to better discriminate the population 266 benefiting most from tocilizumab treatment. Although IL-6 measurements are rarely 267 available in clinical settings, CRP is widely accessible and is an inflammatory 268 biomarker upstream of the IL-6 pathway.[5] Hence, we doubt that the use of CRP 269 instead of IL-6 limited the scope of the results. Ongoing trials of tocilizumab in 270 COVID-19 have also considered CRP instead of IL-6 to identify patients with 271 heightened inflammation and, therefore, potential greater benefit with this treatment 272 (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04346355 and NCT04356937). Despite the fact that the size 273 effects observed in the sensitivity analyses were consistent with those obtained in the 274 principal analyses, they should be interpreted as exploratory and hypothesis-275",

[14,15] 79Here, we investigate the association between tocilizumab use and mortality in a large80 cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Spain. We hypothesized that tocilizumab 81 use would be associated with a lower risk of death and influenced by baseline systemic 82 inflammation levels. We used marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and 83 time-varying confounders. 84 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Study design, setting, and data sources We analyzed data from 2,047 patients included in the HM Hospitales cohort-a 88 multicenter cohort of people admitted to any of the 17 hospitals in the HM Group in 89 Spain and diagnosed with COVID-19 from January 31 st to April 23 rd , 2020. HM 90 Hospitales made their anonymous dataset freely accessible to the international medical 91 and scientific community.[16] The dataset includes comprehensive clinical 92 information on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by polymerase chain 93 reaction on nasopharyngeal swabs or other respiratory specimens. The dataset collects 94 the different interactions in the COVID-19 treatment process, including detailed 95 information on diagnoses, treatments, admissions, ICU admissions, diagnostic imaging 96tests, laboratory results, discharge or death. It includes more than 60,000 drug 97 records, 54,000 vital sign records, and more than 398,000 laboratory records, which 98 include all the requests made to each patient during admission and in the previous 99 emergency, if any. Moreover, more than 1,900 diagnostic and procedural records are 100 collected and coded according to the International Statistical Classification of Disease 101",
