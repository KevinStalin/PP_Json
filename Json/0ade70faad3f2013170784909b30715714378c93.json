Here, we determine the X-ray crystal structure of a potent neutralizing monoclonal antibody, CV30, isolated from a patient infected with SARS-CoV-2, in complex with the receptor binding domain. The structure reveals that CV30 binds to an epitope that overlaps with the human ACE2 receptor binding motif providing a structural basis for its neutralization. CV30 also induces shedding of the S1 subunit, indicating an additional mechanism of neutralization. A germline reversion of CV30 results in a substantial reduction in both binding affinity and neutralization potential indicating the minimal somatic mutation is needed for potently neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

As of 9 August 2020, there were~19.5 million infections and over 728,000 deaths worldwide 2 . It is caused by a coronavirus of the \u03b2-family, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 3 , as it is closely related to SARS-CoV-1 4 . Their genomes share 80% identity and they utilize angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as receptor for entry [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Viral entry depends on the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, a class I fusion protein that comprised two subunits, S1 and S2. S1 mediates ACE2 binding through the receptor-binding domain (RBD), whereas the S2 subunit mediates fusion. Overall, the spike shares 76% amino acid sequence homology with SARS 4 . High-resolution structures of the SARS-CoV-2-stabilized spike in the prefusion revealed that the RBD can be seen in a up or down conformation 5,6 . It's been shown that some of the neutralizing antibodies bind the RBD in the up conformation similar to when the ACE2 receptor binds 12 . Currently, there is no vaccine available to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and highly effective therapeutics have not been developed yet either. The host immune response to this new coronavirus is also not well understood. We, and others, sought to characterize the humoral immune response from infected COVID-19 patients [12] [13] [14] . Recently, we isolated a neutralizing antibody, named CV30, which binds the RBD, neutralizes a pseudovirus with an IC 50 of 0.03 \u03bcg/ml and competes binding with ACE2 15 . However, the molecular mechanism by which CV30 blocked ACE2 binding was unknown. Herein, we present the 2.75 \u00c5 crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD in complex with the Fab of CV30, assess the role of affinity maturation and determine in details its mechanism of neutralization.",

Twenty residues from the heavy chain and 10 residues from the light chain interact with the RBD, forming 13 and 2 hydrogen bonds, respectively (Fig. 1b, c and Supplementary  Table 2 ). There are 29 residues from the RBD that interact with CV30, 19 residues with the heavy chain, 7 residues with the light chain, and 3 residues with both (Supplementary Table 2 ). Of the 29 interacting residues from the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, only 16 are conserved in the SARS-CoV-1 S protein RBD (Fig. 2c) , which could explain the lack of cross-reactivity of CV30 to SARS-CoV-1 S as we observed previously by biolayer interferometry (BLI) 15 and to SARS-CoV-1 RBD by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ).",

We reverted these residues to germline to assess the role of affinity maturation to RBD-binding and neutralization potency. The germline CV30 (glCV30) antibody bound to RBD with~100-fold lower affinity (407 nM) ( Fig. 1d and Supplementary Table 3 ) compared to CV30 (3.6 nM 15 ), which was largely due to a much faster off-rate for glCV30. glCV30 neutralized SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus with~350-fold less potency with an IC 50 of 10.3 vs. 0.03 \u03bcg/mL for CV30 (Fig. 1e) .",

Compared to the pseudovirus assay, CV30 neutralized the live virus less potently, with an IC 50 of 0.118 \u03bcg/mL, whereas glCV30 failed to achieve 50% neutralization (Fig. 1f ). Val27 forms a weak nonpolar interaction with the RBD Asn487 and sits in a pocket formed by CDRH1 and CDRH3. It is possible that Phe27, present in glCV30, could change the electrostatic environment, thus contributing to the lower affinity and neutralization. The Ile28 sidechain forms nonpolar interactions with the RBD Gly476-Ser447, particularly the C \u03b3 atom, which the glCV30 Thr28 would be incapable of making. Thus, minimal affinity maturation that occurred in CV30 significantly impacted the ability of this monoclonal antibody (mAb) to bind and neutralize SARS-CoV-2.",

We have shown previously that CV30 competes with ACE2 for binding to the RBD 15 and we therefore examined the structural mechanism of the receptor blocking by superimposing the SARS-CoV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex (PDB: 6LZG) 9 with the CV30 Fab/RBD complex. The structure of the RBD was used to align the two complexes and showed that CV30 binding did not induce any conformational changes in the RBD from the ACE2-bound complex. The aligned RBD had a RMSD of 0.353 \u00c5 over 166 C \u03b1 atoms. The structure reveals that the CV30 epitope overlaps almost completely with the ACE2 epitope. A total of 26 residues of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD interact with hACE2, CV30 binds to 19 of these residues (Fig. 2a) , indicating that CV30 likely neutralizes the virus by preventing the binding of ACE2 to RBD by direct steric interactions. In addition, it was recently shown that ACE2 blocking antibodies could induce premature shedding of the S1 subunit as a mechanism of neutralization 16, 17 . We incubated HEK-293-6E cells expressing full-length SARS-CoV-2 S isolate USA-WA1/2020 with saturating concentrations of CV30 or glCV30 and monitored the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of antibody binding over time by fluorescence-activated cells sorting (FACS) 16 . CV30 showed greatly decreased binding compared to CR3022 control, which has been shown to not induce shedding 18 , indicating that CV30 binding leads to S1 dissociation (Fig. 2b ). glCV30 showed a slight decrease in binding again indicating that minimal mutations have a large effect on the function of CV30.",

Both CV30 and B38 use IGHV3-53*01, whereas CB6 uses IGHV3-66*01, which is only one amino acid different than 3-53*01 (Val12, which does not make contact with the epitope). CV30 and CB6 each have higher affinities, 3.6 and 2.5 nM, respectively, than B38, 70.1 nM 12, 14, 15 . Differences in affinity translate into differences in neutralization potency (the IC50s for CV30 and CB6 are 0.03 and 0.036 \u03bcg/mL, respectively, and that of B38 is 0.177 \u03bcg/ mL). Interestingly, Thr28 was also mutated from germline to Ile in B38 but Phe27 was not. CB6 lacks both mutations found in CV30. Differences in other regions of the antibody, such as the CDRH3 and light chain are likely responsible for the overall potency all these antibodies (see below). To investigate the binding mechanism of the three antibodies, a superposition of the structures was created. All three bind in a nearly identical manner with the same angle of approach and similar footprints (Fig. 2c) . The alignment of the Fv regions of B38 (PDB: 7BZ5) 14 and CB6 (PDB: 7C01) 12 to the Fv region of CV30 had a RMSD of 0.240 \u00c5 over 100 C \u03b1 atoms and 0.329 \u00c5 over 98 C \u03b1 atoms, respectively.",

One of the more interesting findings was the interaction of Thr56 in the CV30 CDRL2, which reaches across the RBD and interacts with Phe486, an interaction that is not found in the other two antibodies ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ).

Binding of CV30 to cells expressing the SARS-CoV-2 S protein decreased overtime indicating shedding of the S1 subunit as a mechanism of neutralization that complements the steric prevention of S binding to ACE2. It is noteworthy that potently neutralizing antibodies isolated from multiple individuals use the same or similar VH gene to target their epitope, as it has been shown more recently by published studies 12, 14, 19, 20 . In addition, the minimal affinity maturation observed 21 days after infection in the VH gene of CV30 showed~100-500-fold increase in affinity and neutralization potency, indicating that further affinity maturation may increase potency and potential crossreactivity. Our studies indicate that the RBD is a promising target for vaccine design, and that these potently neutralizing antibodies should be explored as a treatment for COVID-19 infection.",

Menachery and P.Y. Shi) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The antibody-virus mixture was added to VeroE6 cell (C1008, ATCC, #CRL-1586) monolayers and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Post incubation, the antibody-virus mixture was removed and 100 \u03bcL of prewarmed 0.85% methylcellulose (Sigma, #M0512-250) was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. After 24 h, methylcellulose overlay was removed, cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Following fixation, plates were washed twice with 1x PBS and 100 \u00b5l of permeabilization buffer (0.1% BSA-Saponin in PBS) (Sigma Aldrich), was added to the fixated Vero cell monolayer for 20 minutes. Cells were incubated with an anti-SARS-CoV spike protein primary antibody conjugated to biotin (CR3022biotin) for 1 hour at room temperature, then with avidin-HRP conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Foci were visualized using True Blue HRP substrate and imaged on an ELISPOT reader (CTL). Foci were visualized using an ELISPOT reader (CTL ImmunoSpot S6 Universal Analyzer) and enumerated using Viridot 29 . The average number of foci in the virus only sample (duplicate) were used to calculate the neutralization curves: 1 \u2212 (ratio of mean number of foci in the presence of mAb and virus only control). The antibody concentration that neutralized 50% of infectivity (IC50) was interpolated using a four-parameter nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism 8.4. mAb binding to cell surface expressed SARS-CoV-2 S over time. cDNA for the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S isolate USA-WA1/2020 was codon optimized and synthesized by Twist Biosciences and cloned into the pTT3 vector using InFusion cloning (Clontech). pTT3-SARS-CoV-2-S was transfected into HEK-293-6E cells (National Research Council of Canada, under license) using 293 Free transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions.

The next day, 200,000 cells in 60 \u03bcL of FreeStyle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Pen/Strep were added to a round-bottom 96-well plate. 300 nM mAb in FreeStyle medium and the cells were equilibrated separately for 15 min to 37\u00b0C. At each timepoint (180, 120, 60, 30, 20, 10, 5 min), 30 \u03bcL of each mAb were mixed with the cell suspension to a final concentration of 100 nM mAb. After incubation for the allotted time, the samples were placed on ice and washed twice with ice-cold FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS + 1 mM EDTA) before staining cells with PE-conjugated AffiniPure Fab fragment goat anti-human IgG (1 : 50 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch, catalog number 109-117-008) for 30 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer and stained with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor 506 (1 : 200 dilution, eBioscience, catalog number 65-0866-14) for 20 min on ice in the dark. Cells were washed once with FACS buffer, fixed with 10% formalin for 15 min on ice in the dark, and resuspended in 200 \u03bcL of FACS buffer to be analyzed by flow cytometry using a LSRII (BD). Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each sample was determined at each timepoint and each sample was normalized to the MFI at the 5 min timepoint (MFI/MFI 5 min \u00d7 100).",
