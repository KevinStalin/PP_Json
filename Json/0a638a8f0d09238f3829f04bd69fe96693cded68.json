            "text": "Social media analysis has become a common approach to assess public opinion on various topics, including those about health, in near real-time. The growing volume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machine learning methods in natural language processing. While the rapid dynamics of social media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technical problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when applied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of interest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed. Here, we explore the effect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentiments expressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that while vaccine sentiment has declined considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, algorithms trained on pre-pandemic data would have largely missed this decline due to concept drift. Our results suggest that social media analysis systems must address concept drift in a continuous fashion in order to avoid the risk of systematic misclassification of data, which is particularly likely during a crisis when the underlying data can change suddenly and rapidly.",

At the core of these algorithms is their ability to make sense of a vast amount of semi-structured real-time data streams, allowing them to automatically categorize or filter new data examples into, usually pre-defined, classes. Multi-class text classification has been successfully used in public health surveillance, election monitoring, or vaccine stance prediction [1, 2, 3] . In recent years such algorithms have also been developed to mitigate the negative effects of social media, such as in the detection of cyber-bullying, hate speech, misinformation, and automated accounts (bots) [4, 5, 6, 7] .",

A classic example of concept drift is the change in the meaning of classes, which requires an update of the learned class decision boundaries in the classifier. This is sometimes also referred to as real concept drift. Often, however, an observed performance change is a consequence of a change in the underlying data distribution, leading to what is known as virtual drift [12, 13] . Virtual drift can be overcome by supplemental learning, i.e. collecting training data from the new environment. A good example are periodic seasonality effects, which may not be fully represented in the initial training data and only become fully visible over time. However, in practice it is usually very difficult (if not impossible) to disentangle virtual from real concept drift, and as a consequence they are treated as the same effect [10] .",

Sudden shifts in a debate might be triggered by a quickly evolving news cycle or a catastrophic event. Concept drift may also be a slow process in which the way a topic is discussed gradually changes over time. A substantial amount of work has been dedicated to detecting and overcoming concept drift [12, 10, 14] . Three basic re-training procedures for overcoming concept drift have been proposed: (i) a time-window approach, (ii) an incremental model, and (iii) an ensemble model [8] . In the time-window approach, a sliding window of recent training examples is used to train an algorithm. In this approach, the algorithm ignores training data collected outside of that time window. The incremental model, in contrast, uses all previously collected training examples to re-train the model. Lastly, the ensemble model trains a model for each time window and uses the consensus of all previous models for future predictions. As found in [8] , in the case of hashtag prediction on Twitter data, the incremental method gave the best results.",

For this we used a sliding time window approach, as first proposed in [8] . We dissected the collected 11,893 annotations into 13 bins of 90 days each. From each bin we sampled 550 examples and split them into a train (n = 400, 72%) and evaluation (n = 150, 27%) set (see Figure 1 ). Each model was trained on a window of 4 bins of training data, which is equivalent to 1600 samples and a time span of 360 days. The models are subsequently evaluated on the evaluation set corresponding to the bin at the end of their training window as well as on all future evaluation sets. We repeat the process of binning, splitting, training and evaluating 50 times in order to yield a measure of confidence to our results. Figure 2 shows the classifier performance at training time (square symbol) and the performance at each future evaluation dataset (circle symbol) for classifiers trained on different training windows (color). The upper left panel shows the results of these experiments for the FastText models. We will first compare the initial performance in terms of F1-macro score (i.e. the arithmetic mean of the class-level F1 scores) of the classifiers on a test dataset which was sampled from the last bin of the corresponding training window (square symbols). The initial performance of the first model is at 0.42, the subsequent models plateau at around 0.50, followed by a peak in fall 2019 with an abrupt decline in January 2020. This variability in the initial performance of models points to considerable differences between training datasets over time. The performance of the FastText models is quite low in general, which may be a consequence of the relatively small training dataset of 1600 examples and the lack of hyperparameter tuning.",

Based on these results, it can be expected that future crisis situations would lead to similarly strong concept drift, thereby severely undermining the utility of social media monitoring tools that do not take concept drift into account. This is especially true for applications which are intended to be used exactly in such circumstances.",

Annotators were asked the question \"What is the attitude of the author of the tweet regarding vaccines?\" and given the three options \"negative\", \"neutral\", and \"positive\". Annotation was performed both on Amazon Turk (mTurk) and, to a smaller extent (roughly 1% of all annotations) by public users on the Crowdbreaks website. We yield a dataset of 44,843 annotations (Fleiss' kappa of 0.30), which resulted in 11,893 three-fold annotated tweets.

Optimal results were yielded by lower casing texts, converting them to ASCII and using the tags \"user\" and \"url\" for anonymization. BERT models of the type bert-largeuncased (pretrained in English language) were trained for 20 epochs, training batch size of 32, and a learning rate 2 \u00d7 10 \u22125 (using 10% warmup with linear decay to zero), as recommended in recent literature [28, 29] .
