To date, no specific drug or vaccine is available to treat this infectious disease. Scientists across the world are looking for novel diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic interventions. The COVID-19 virus infects the host by binding to host cells, gain entry into the cells than multiply by replication and transcription of viral genome achieved by assembling a multisubunit RNA-synthesis complex of viral non-structural proteins (Nsp). Based on genome sequence published in RCSB, several proteins were identified that includes spike (S) proteins, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and a nonstructural protein (Nsp) that can be used as suitable drug targets (Gordan et al., 2020). Nsps (such as Nsp12, Nsp13, Nsp14 and Nsp15 are the product of the cleavage of polyproteins by the main protease (Mpro), which gathers into a replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) (Kong et al., 2020). Nsp 15, also called uridylate-specific endoribonuclease preferentially cleaves 3' end of uridines. It is encoded by the coronaviruses as RNA-processing enzymes and hence, identified to play is essential for viral replication in the host cells. Studies have shown that inhibition of Nsp15 can slow viral replication (Deng and Baker, 2018). This emphasizes on Nsp15 as a drug target for the development of a potential inhibitor of COVID-19.",

Nsp15 plays a vital role in viral replication and is responsible for interference with the innate immune response (Kindler et al., 2017). The dimer structure of Nsp15 of novel SARS-CoV-2 (6VWW) was processed using PyMol to prepare protein for docking. Three-dimensional structures of phytochemicals and suspected inhibitors (nelfinavir, hydroxychloroquine) were downloaded from the PubChem Database. Ligand processing was performed using PyMol, and hydrogen was added to the structures. Docking protocol was developed with a grid dimension of -90.6*22.12*-31.68 and validated by performing blind docking with inhibitors in the active site, and the docking maps were generated.

The Nsp15 protein and phytochemicals were docked with Swissdock using default parameters. Docking results were observed using offline with UCSF-Chimera. The values were obtained in terms of energy full fitness and deltaG Kcal/mol. Different docking poses were screened based on deltaG Kcal/mol value; the appropriateness of the docked pose means lowest deltaG Kcal/mol energy. The best deltaG Kcal/mol was found with apigenin,",

Recently, NendoU activity of Nsp15 is found responsible for the protein interference with the innate immune response(Deng et al., 2017). Therefore, Nsp15 is essential in coronavirus biology. Because of this, the Nsp15 protein was chosen for the molecular docking study with phytochemicals that were reviewed from the literature. Natural phytochemicals are known for their non-toxicity and possess anti-viral activity(Naithani et al., 2008). The benefits of using phytochemicals are immense, as these are less toxic than synthetic drugs. They also provide health benefits by playing a synergetic rolewithinn the human body. They are eco-friendly molecules which can have therapeutic value. Several phytochemicals such as alkaloids, terpenoids, saponins ,and polyphenols arereported to possess antiviral activity (Liu and Du., 2012). The previous study by Umesh et al., 2020 showed carnosol, rosmanol, and arjunglucoside-I, natural phytochemicals as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV main protease using molecular docking approach. Similarly, Das et al., 2020 showed rutin with the highest inhibition efficiency for SARS-CoV main protease, among other phytochemicals. Phytochemical piperine and curcumin also showed anti-viral property against influenza, chikungunya, and zika viruses (Couceiro et al., 2005; Mounce et al., 2017). The present study demonstrated sarsasapogenin, ursonic acid, apigenin, curcumin, ajmalicine, novobiocin, silymarin, and aranotin are strongly binding to Nsp15 target and could be used as promising strong inhibitors. Sarsasapogenin interacted with catalytic triad residue Lys290 with a strong single hydrogen bond of such low binding energy of -8.5, which made sarsasapogenin a lead potential inhibitor. Other phytochemical ursonic acid showed low binding energy of -8.4 with Nsp 15 protein. However, an MD study based on PEM, Equilibrated NVT-NPT, radius of gyration, RMSD and RMSF revealed that ursonic acid complex is more stable than sarsasapogenin complex, making ursonic acid a more potent inhibitor of Nsp15 when compared with sarsasapogenin. Previous studies have also shown anti-viral property of sarsasapogenin and ursonic acid against chikungunya viruses and rotavirus, respectively (Troost et al., 2020; Tohme et al., 2019). This study thus showed the significance of phytochemicals based drug discovery to find novel coronavirus drugs.",
