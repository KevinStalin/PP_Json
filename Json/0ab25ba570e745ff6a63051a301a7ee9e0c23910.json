Active involvement in the recruitment of inflammatory cells in liver injury by pericytes is a well-known mechanism; inflammatory process may induce myofibroblast-like cells transformation of pericytes generating quick and abundant amounts of extracellular matrix proteins and finally leading to vessel wall fibrosis. 13 A crucial question is if any previous chronic asymptomatic condition such as phlebosclerosis noted in variable degree of severity in all biopsies could be a hidden predisposing factor to liver damage partially related to the advanced age of the patients. This precondition may be exacerbated by a further inflammatory injury and pericytes activation induced by viral infection and clearly evident in our material.",

Although lungs seem to be the main target of the infection, very few information are available about liver involvement, possibly evocating a systemic disease. Post-mortem wedge liver biopsies from 48 patients died from severe pulmonary COVID-19 disease with respiratory failure were collected from two main hospitals in northern Italy. No patient had clinical symptoms of liver disease or signs of liver failure before and during hospitalization; for each of them liver function tests were available. All liver samples showed minimal inflammation features. Histological pictures compatible with vascular alterations were observed, characterized by increase in number of portal vein branches associated with lumen massive dilatation, partial or complete luminal thrombosis of portal and sinusoidal vessels, fibrosis of portal tract, focally markedly enlarged and fibrotic.

Central veins did not show significant alteration of lumen calibre and of wall configuration. Majority of portal fields showed an increased number of portal veins associated with luminal severe dilatation (Figure 2A) and wall fibrosis (Figure 2B); in a large number of portal veins the lumen focally herniated in periportal liver parenchyma and completely circumscribed by liver cells plates (Figure 2C). Kupffer cells were found extremely activated with large cytoplasm containing necrotic debris (Figure 2D).In order to exclude post-mortem cloths, only vessels with clearly enlarged lumen occupied by red cells mixed with lymphocytes and granulocytes were considered affected by thrombotic process.Questionable cases were reviewed jointly by two pathologists and diagnosis of thrombosis reported only if complete agreement was met (Figure 3A). Steatosis (large droplets, small droplets, mixed large and small droplets) was observed in more than 50% of samples; all 18 obese patients showed liver steatosis, which was also found in 14 overweight subjects (BMI >25, <30).Smooth muscle layer of portal vein lamina media was fragmented (Figure 3B), partially lost and occasionally infiltrated by inflammatory cells lymphocytes, likewise overlying endothelium (Figure 3C).

            "text": "studies concerning description and interpretation of liver parenchymal changes induced or related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are completely lacking. By now only one post-mortem report is available in Chinese language and focused mainly on lung destructing lesions 1 ; a review paper quoted a single case of liver post-mortem biopsy, pointing out bile duct damage as main histological feature. 2 Some authors stressed peculiar severe alterations of clotting parameters induced by viral infection. 3 Lung histopathological injury induced by COVID-19 infection has been extensively investigate in the largest group of subjects till now described, confirming severe thrombotic disturbances. 4 Knowledge of liver pathology is totally blank and there are no comparisons available at present time among laboratory findings and liver histology. Since outbreak of this pandemic in Lombardy (Italy), we had the unique option to collect a large series of liver samples of patients dead with SARS-CoV-2 infection: furthermore laboratory tests were available allowing a comparison between morphology and biochemical findings. Liver histology examination demonstrated that this organ is not involved in any significant inflammatory response to SARS-Cov-2 virus detected by ISH in tissue and does not develop any significant clinical and histological bile duct damage, in disagreement with a previous single report 2 ; our data strongly support the clinical impression that liver failure is not a main issue in management of COVID-19-affected patients, as previously pointed out. 5 All our morphological findings are consistent with a vascular-related damage caused by impaired blood flow, generating lesions similar to histological picture observed in hepatopulmonary syndrome and in obliterative portal venopathy. 6-9 Moreover diffuse network of sinusoids decorated by CD34 additionally suggests a disturbed circulation of blood within the liver. 10 A presumable physiopathological explanation could be an increased blood flow within the liver, sometimes related to heart distress, and/or thrombotic phenomena in portal and sinusoidal vessels which modify intrahepatic blood circulation. High D-dimer levels in blood, previously described a risk factor in COVID 19 disease, 11 were evident in most patients and support this hypothesis along with histological changes in lungs of patients dead from COVID-19 infection which display huge number of thrombotic medium and small calibre branches of pulmonary arteries infection. 4The abnormal high levels of transaminases observed in three patients could be explained by extensive vascular portal and sinusoidal thrombosis, leading to confluent parenchymal necrosis and liver cells accelerated apoptosis. To support this hypothesis, we underline that cases of obliterative portal venopathy 6,9 were associated with vessel lumen and on endothelial cells (ISH) (inset); C: medium layer of a portal vein, partially lost and infiltrated by inflammatory cells lymphocytes, also attaching endothelial layer (SMA, 400X); CD3-positive lymphocytes attack endothelium and medium vessel layer (inset); D: severe confluent haemorrhagic necrosis in a patient with elevation of ALT > 10 N (H&E, 100X); inset showing liver necrosis by apoptosis (H&E, 400X) acquired anomalies of some factors activated during clotting cascade. Another putative mechanism could be an immunological attack to endothelial layer, recently reported about lungs.12 The histological findings strengthen the hypothesis that the derangement of coagulation process or impairment of blood circulation or endothelial damage could be main triggers mechanism in pathogenesis of COVID-19 damage, not only within the liver but probably also in other solid organs. This theory fits really well with some recently published observations by a British group focusing the main rule of clotting system in COVID-19 liver damage. 5F I G U R E 4 Biochemical changes in liver function tests (AST, ALT, GGT [fold-x-URL], albumin g/l) (top), PT-INR, D-Dimer and platelets (bottom).
