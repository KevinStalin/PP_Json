In terms of number of cases, Spain tops the chart with 22857 cases followed by Italy and the United Kingdom Table 2 shows the situation in top 10 countries as on July 10 2020, July 13 and August 8 th .When we compare table 1 and 2 tables it can be seen that the situation has changed phenomenally. New countries like Russia, India and Peru have been added. Be it country wise / number wise, cases are rising at a rapid rate. European countries have the highest infection and death rates, when compared to Asian countries. If we compare both tables we can conclude the phenomenal rise of cases and deaths in all countries. Except the US order of all countries has changed with new countries like South Africa and Columbia adding in the list Reason may be due to differences in testing in various countries. Countries with lowest mortality rate deployed early testing since January 2020. Although lack of testing may result in underestimation of cases/ deaths, countries that have better control of the outbreak ensured wide access to testing. Another explanation may be that countries define/ report COVID-19-related deaths differently, and those methods changed over time. The attribution of cause of death to COVID-19 may vary country wise, especially since most of these deaths occur in people with chronic illnesses. As per an article (9), in Hong Kong, 60% of cases comprised of students/ expatriates who were returning home. In Singapore, cases among foreign worker dormitories were 80% whereas community cases were hardly 10%. These younger populations are healthy and may contribute to overall lower mortality rates. In contrast, in European countries such as France and Italy, and in the U.S., community outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities contribute to higher infection and mortality rates among the elderly.",

Median ages among Hispanic (71 years)and nonwhite decedents (72 years) was 9-10 years lower than that of white decedents (81 years) (8, 12) .As per an Indian news column , 43% deaths have taken place in the relatively younger age groups of 30-44 and 45-59 years(13). (4)As per a Meta analysis, the median age range is 28-70 in the 13 selected studies. Average median age was 47 \u00b1 7 years. The Meta analysis also concluded that male cases were more compared to female cases and this was confirmed by another Meta analysis (16) . Another meta-analysis (14, 15) suggested that age and co morbidities were highly related in COVID-19 patients. The previous meta-analysis has found J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f similar results while studying the gender in COVID-19 (10, 13). Another study quoted that the median period from symptom onset to death was 13 days (ranging of IQR 11 to 18 days). Of these deceased patients, 64.9% had at least one underlying disorder (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17)",

Patient's presenting late or deteriorating patients may suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, acute renal injury, and multi-organ failure. (18) Evidence suggests that some patients with severe COVID-19 suffer from a \"cytokine storm.\" A condition many cytokines are releases into the blood at once. Analysis of cytokine levels in plasma of 41 COVID-19 confirmed cases in China revealed elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, FGF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-\u03b3, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1A, MIP1-B, PDGF, TNF-\u03b1, and VEGF among admitted as well as non admitted patients when compared to healthy adults.

As per another Meta analysis (23) commonly reported symptoms like fever, cough, and shortness of breath were not reported in a similar proportion inside and outside China.

Introduction: Covid 19 virus/disease was unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. It is now a pandemic affecting various countries globally. 213 countries /territories have registered COVID-19 cases.

Both diseases attack the lungs and both are transmitted via close contact. Incubation period in Tuberculosis is longer, with a slow onset as compared toCovid 19  .As per world health organization (WHO); people ill with both Tuberculosis and COVID-19 may have poorer treatment outcomes, especially when Tuberculosis treatment is interrupted. Old age, diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are linked with COVID-19 and are also risk factors for poor outcomes in Tuberculosis. National health programmes must combat both the disease while ensuring uninterrupted services to Tuberculosis patients (7). As per an article , COVID-19 pandemic may be responsible for HIV related deaths by up to 10%, due to tuberculosis , up to 20%, and due to malaria ,up to 36%, over 5 years compared ,if no COVID-19 pandemic occurred.(8)19.

Globally, the total cases crossed the 12-million mark Experiences from world over: In April 2020, the WHO had launched Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator programme which aims at accelerating the development, production, and equitable access to tests, treatments and vaccines for the Covid-19 disease by the name of COVAX. It is led by Gavi, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and WHO.As per a news article it aims to distribute 2 billion doses of vaccine through this initiative by 2021. (37, 38). The WHO office in Dakar (30), Senegal, organized various virtual workshops to share experiences and lessons learnt in preparedness/ response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Central Africa, along with strengthening of cross-border collaboration. Aim of this meet was to update all on recent developments in the COVID-19 response at Points of Entry .Other interventions like serology surveillance strategy CDC (31), vaccine development initiates taken up by various J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o fcountries are being taken up. The WHO has advised comprehensive surveillance and testing for suspected cases. It also advised that a country needs to conduct 140 tests per day per million populations. In India 22 states are doing more than 140 COVID-19 tests per day per million in lines with comprehensive testing guidance (32)As per the WHO regional office for Africa, COVID-19 cross-border collaboration mechanisms have been built on already existing bi-lateral and/or multi-lateral cross-border collaboration schemes. India is now in a decisive phase of the response. WHO has strengthened cluster containment activities and surveillance at all levels as well as strengthening real-time data collection activities.

Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and Canada with experience of handling Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 led them to develop national strategies for the next outbreak. SARS experience also resulted in a higher level of public acceptance and adherence to masking and social distancing measures. Adoption of measures like case identification , testing and isolation of all cases , identification/ quarantine /testing of close contacts of infected people ,use of fabric masks ,adoption of contact droplet precautions and airborne precautions and adoption of frequent hand washing, physical distancing, and respiratory etiquette , avoiding crowded places, close-contact settings and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.
