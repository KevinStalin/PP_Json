Egolum, MD, FACC During the COVID-19 pandemic, the heart failure (HF) community witnessed unprecedented declines in HF-related patient visits and hospitalizations. Studies to date have focused on the impact of the initial phase of the COVID-19 lockdown of HF hospitalization trends across multiple countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] It is likely that patients with HF, who are at higher risk for morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, delay seeking care in large part due to anxiety about contracting the virus. Nevertheless, the concerns may resolve over time with availability of treatment for COVID-19 and overwhelming HF symptom burden. Furthermore, the decision to seek acute HF care may be affected by the announcements of state governments relaxing Shelter-in-Place restrictions and allowing opening of businesses.",

Unique to our analysis is that Georgia was the first state to lift Shelter-in-Place orders. We observed that HF hospitalization rates returned to historical values two weeks after reopening and was maintained thereafter. No surge in HF hospitalization was seen, despite the \"hospitalization debt\" incurred during the Public Health State of Emergency and Shelterin-Place periods. The reduced LOS likely reflects patient preference for earlier discharge and physician response in an effort to minimize potential exposure to COVID-19. As states lift shelter-in-place orders, healthcare facilities should be prepared for an increase in HF hospitalizations. It is unclear if a surge in admissions will be seen at a future date. At the time of this writing, COVID-19 cases are spiking in southern states including Georgia. Whether the recovered HF hospitalization in our health system will be durable amid this alarming increase is unknown. ",
