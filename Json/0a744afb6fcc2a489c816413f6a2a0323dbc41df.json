            "text": "Although SARS-CoV-2 is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols, transmission by fomites remains plausible. During Halloween, a major event for children in numerous countries, SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk via candy fomites worries many parents. To address this concern, we enrolled 10 recently diagnosed asymptomatic or mildly/moderately symptomatic COVID-19 patients to handle typical Halloween candy (pieces individually wrapped) under three conditions: normal handling with unwashed hands, deliberate coughing and extensive touching, and normal handling following handwashing. We then used a factorial design to subject the candies to two posthandling treatments: no washing (untreated) and household dishwashing detergent. We measured SARS-CoV-2 load by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). From the candies not washed posthandling, we detected SARS-CoV-2 on 60% of candies that were deliberately coughed on, 60% of candies normally handled with unwashed hands, but only 10% of candies handled after hand washing. We found that treating candy with dishwashing detergent reduced SARS-CoV-2 load by 62.1% in comparison to untreated candy. Taken together, these results suggest that although the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by fomites is low even from known COVID-19 patients, viral RNA load can be reduced to near zero by the combination of handwashing by the infected patient and \u05461 min detergent treatment after collection. We also found that the inexpensive and fast LAMP protocol was more than 80% concordant with RT-qPCR. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic is leading to important tradeoffs between risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and mental health due to deprivation from normal activities, with these impacts be-Citation Salido RA, Morgan SC, Rojas MI,",

Due to the ongoing pandemic, Halloween activities will be curtailed as a result of the concern that candy from strangers might act as fomites. Here, we demonstrate that these risks can be mitigated by ensuring that, prior to handling candy, the candy giver washes their hands and, after receipt, by washing candy with household dishwashing detergent. Even in the most extreme case, with candy deliberately coughed on by known COVID-19 patients, viral load was reduced dramatically after washing with household detergent. We conclude that with reasonable precautions, even if followed only by either the candy giver or the candy recipient, the risk of viral transmission by this route is very low.",

Fear of infection has severely curtailed normal activities. In the United States, Halloween is a major children's holiday, but fear of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by candy is leading many parents to plan on keeping their children from participating. Quantifying the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by candy is therefore of compelling interest.",

Patients were recruited to the study via phone call after they tested positive via UCSD Health, were aged 18 to 55 (7 female and 3 male), and were either mildly/moderately symptomatic (9/10) or asymptomatic (1/10). Six of the symptomatic patients reported symptoms of cough. Each individual was provided with four bags containing two Halloween candies (combination of Haribo gummies, Twix, M&Ms, Starburst, and Snickers), allocated as follows: bag 1, candies handled normally with unwashed hands; bag 2, candies coughed on and handled with unwashed hands; bag 3, candies handled after thorough hand washing with soap for 20 s, per CDC guidelines; and bag 4, left as a thank you gift to the subject for their participation. In a factorial design, we then assigned one candy from each bag to either untreated/no washing, or household dishwashing detergent containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) diluted 1:50, for \u05461 min (Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).",

Result outcomes did not differ significantly between RT-qPCR and LAMP ( 2 \u03ed 0.399, df \u03ed 2, P \u03ed 0.818) (Fig. 1D) .

First, even candies handled by a known COVID-19 patient have low or undetectable viral loads if reasonable precautions, such as hand washing before handling candies, or washing candies with detergent after collecting, are employed. Second, even candies that have been deliberately contaminated by coughing can be treated with mild household dishwashing detergent, such that only 20% have any detectable signal by RT-qPCR. A treatment of \u05461 min with SLS from domestic dishwashing detergent can reduce infectious viral particles by 3,000-fold (4-6). An important limitation of this experiment is that we only studied viral RNA, not infectious particles; detection of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA does not necessarily indicate infectious virus. Previous work reported that only samples with SARS-CoV-2 detected with Cq \u03fd 30 were capable of infection (7) .",

Both the extensively handled and coughed-on candy (B) and the candy that was normally handled with unwashed hands (C) had detectable viral genes with comparable Cq values ranging from 29.77 to 39.28. Treating with detergent reduced the viral load on candies, measured as an increase in Cq, or resulted in undetectable viral load. Washing hands before handling candy (D) markedly decreased viral gene detection rate and decreased viral load on positive candies.

Positive results were called on samples for which at least two out of three viral genes were detected. Inconclusive results were called when only one viral gene was detected and negative results when no viral genes were detected. Positive results display the average Cq values across detected genes, while inconclusive results report a single Cq value for the detected gene. (B) Heatmap of results from SARS-CoV-2 LAMP detection assay. Positive results were called on colorimetric readouts that matched the positive control, while negative results were called on colorimetric matches to the negative control. Inconclusive results were called on RT-PCRs that were inhibited. (C) Heatmap of comparison of results between RT-qPCR and LAMP. The heatmap shows 83% concordance when excluding the negative to inconclusive mismatches. (D) Classification matrix comparing SARS-CoV-2 detection results between RT-qPCR and LAMP.",
