This result is consistent with previous studies that found higher case-fatality rate among patients with cardiovascular disease [9, 15] . It is worth pointing out that the existing studies [9, 16] that investigate prognostic factors for death used chi-square tests or univariate logistic regression that does not control for potential confounders. In contrast, by conducting weighted Cox proportional hazard regression models, our study used time-to-event outcomes, which offers more survival- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 From the clinical point of view, early evaluation of patient medical history is necessary to implement early medical interventions and decrease the mortality risk. We suggest monitoring the dynamic heart rate for patients with pre-existing CHD. For those severe-symptomatic patients who had pre-existing heart ischemia and abnormal heart function, early medical intervention may be needed [41] . Furthermore, our results indicated that the hazard of COVID-19 death was significantly higher in patients at older ages. Adjusting for others, every 5-year increase in age was associated with a 22% increased risk of death, similarly to what was found in previous studies [8, 9, 16] . Alongside the evidence of prognostic risk in CHD, we suggest that extra care is needed for those with CHD, especially for elderly patients. One limitation of the present study lies in the nature of publicly reported data.",

There were three major findings: First, a history of comorbidities significantly increased the death risk of COVID-19: one additional pre-existing comorbidity led to an estimated 40% increase of death risk (p<0.001). Second, after adjusting for confounders, CHD was the only significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality.

            "text": "94Recently, scholarly attention focuses on identifying the risk factors for death from 95 COVID-19. Some evidence suggests that pre-existing medical conditions are likely death risk 96 factors for COVID-19. For example, a study based on 72,314 cases in China indicated that the 97 case-fatality rate (CFR) tends to be higher among those with older age, and having pre-existing 98 cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension compared to all the patients [9]. Similarly, by 99 conducting logistic regression on odds of in-hospital death among 54 diseased patients and 137 100 recovered patients in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, Zhou et al. [16] found that older age, higher 101 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and d-dimer greater than 1ug/ml at hospital 102 admission were associated with increased odds of in-hospital death. Chen et al. (2020) found that 103 pre-existing hypertension and other cardiovascular complications were more common among 104 diseased patients than recovered patients (unpublished data). 105 However, several gaps remain in the understanding of risk factors for mortality of 106 COVID-19. First, most current research on pre-existing comorbidities of COVID-19 was based 107 on univariate comparison, which did not account for important confounders such as age and 108 gender [17]-[20]. Second, no studies have investigated the hazard of the identified risk factors 109 over time, or the probability of survival at a given time. Under the rapidly changing pandemic 110 situation, it is crucial to provide timely survival-time guidance for implementing the targeted 111 treatment to the high-risk patients in clinical practice. Third, most existing studies on mortality 112 risk factors were focused on patients diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, with little 113 understanding about the mortality risk factors outside of Hubei Province. The risk factors are 114 likely different inside and outside of Hubei Province, since current research has found that the 115 clinical symptom severity [5] and the fatality-case rate [9], [21] to be higher in Hubei Province 116 (the center of outbreak) than cities outside of Hubei Province in China. Fourth, no studies thus 117 far have taken into account the pandemic stage when evaluating mortality risk factors. It has 118 been found that average daily attack rate in China was different before and after January 22 nd 119 2020, since non-pharmaceutical interventions were taken by the government before this date For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml 120 [22]. The change of pandemic stage may also influence the risk factors for fatality associated 121 with COVID-19. 122 To fill the above research gaps in the existing literature about the mortality risk factors 123 for COVID-19, the present study conducted a nested case-control (NCC) study, aiming to 124 evaluate the risk of the common pre-existing comorbidities (hypertension, coronary heart 125 disease, diabetes and etc.) for mortality associated with COVID-19 in mainland China outside of 126 Hubei Province. NCC, also called risk set sampling, has been widely used in studying the fatal 127 disease risk effect in large pharmacoepidemiologic studies [23]-[28] and risk prediction 128 in pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 (pH1N1) [29]. NCC is cost-effective in data collection, 129 and is especially suitable for research on the death risk of diseases such as COVID-19, where the 130 number of event-free people largely exceeds those who experienced events [30]. To attain this 131 goal, we employed survival analysis on 275 publicly reported confirmed cases, adjusting for age, 132 gender and the change in the pandemic stage in China (i.e., before and after January 11 th , 2020). 133 Method 134 Study Design and Rationale 135 This study performed survival analysis under a nested case-control (NCC) design to 136 assess the roles of common comorbidities (cardiocerebrovascular, endocrine and respiratory 137 disease, etc.) in predicting mortality for COVID-19, among patients in mainland China outside of 138 Hubei Province. The study period was from December 18 th , 2019, when the first laboratory-139 confirmed case was announced in China, till March 8 th , 2020. 140 The study cohort was defined as all the publicly reported confirmed COVID-19 patients 141 outside of Hubei Province in mainland China between the study period. During this period, 112 142 deaths outside of Hubei Province were reported by the National Health Committee of China, and 143 18 were excluded from the present study due to missingness of important clinical information. A 144 total of 448 publicly reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases (94 deaths and 354 145 survivors) were initially collected. To avoid selection bias due to intentionally collecting patient 146 with certain pre-existing comorbidities, two authors independently collected, compared and 147 reviewed the full text of each case report. Following the typical NCC design setting where all 148 events are included and a certain numbers of control are matched with replacement, all deaths 149 were included as cases, and each case was matched with up to three controls on gender and age For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml year old (94 cases and 181 controls). The sample distribution across all 32 province-level \u00b1 151 regions in mainland China is presented in Supplementary Table S1. 152 Data Collection Procedure 153 We routinely searched for daily news and public health reports on confirmed COVID-19 154 cases in all areas in mainland China outside of Hubei Province.

Disease infection during the early 267 no-intervention period was associated with a higher risk of death but was not statistically 268 significant.269   In a separate model using the comorbidity score as a predictor, we observed that a 270 higher comorbidity score was associated with a higher mortality risk in both unadjusted and 271 adjusted models (p=0.009 and p=0.03, respectively). All pre-existing comorbidities had an 272 HR over 1 in the univariate model, of which CHD had the largest HR of 4.2 (p<0.001), 276 p=0.55), but not all were statistically significant. After adjusting for age, gender, and the 277 early period of the pandemic in China, CHD was the only comorbidity that yielded a 278 significant mortality risk: COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD had an estimated 2.9279 times higher risk of death than those without CHD. In addition, cerebral infarction, COPD, 280 and renal failure all had an estimated HR of around 2.0. Similar results were observed by 281 using unweighted logistic regression in a sensitivity analysis(Supplementary Table S2).282The overall median follow-up was 40 days, during which 94 deaths were observed.283Figure 2shows the estimated survival probability over 70 days for a sample patient profile 284 with and without CHD (65-year-old female with no other comorbidities). For such a patient 285 profile, having pre-existing CHD led to a significantly shorter survival probability over time 286 compared to those without CHD (p<0.001). For those with CHD, the estimated 30-day 287 survival probability was 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] [0.34-0.82]); on the other hand, 288 this number was 0.85 (95% CI [0.79-0.91]) for those without CHD. 290 In our research, based on publicly reported confirmed cases and adjusted for the 291 confounding effect of age, gender, and the early period of the pandemic when no intervention 292 was taken, we used survival analysis to estimate the fatality risk of pre-existing comorbidities 293 in COVID-19. There were three major findings: First, poor health condition was associated 294 with higher mortality risk of COVID-19. Second, after adjusting for confounders, CHD was 295 the only significant risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. Patients with pre-existing CHD were 296 3.11 times more likely to die than those without CHD (p<0.001). For one patient profile (65-297 year-old female without other comorbidities), we saw an estimated 30-day survival 298 probability of 0.85 (p<0.001).

            "text": "Third, older age was associated with an increased risk of death. Specifically, every 300 1-year increase in age was associated with a 4% increased risk of mortality (p<0.001).301To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to provide substantial 302 statistical evidence showing the effect of CHD in predicting mortality for COVID-19. This 303 result is consistent with previous studies that found higher CFR among patients with 304 cardiovascular disease[9],[15]. It is worth pointing out that the existing studies[9],[16] that 305 investigate prognostic factors for death used chi-square tests or univariate logistic regression 306 that does not control for potential confounders. In contrast, by conducting weighted Cox 307 proportional hazard regression models, our study used time-to-event outcomes, which offer 308 more survival-time-related information to help guide the clinical intervention and more 309 statistical power to detect risk factors [33][34]. 310 Previous studies have indicated that cardiovascular events following pneumonia may 311 increase the risk of mortality [4], [35]-[[40], which explained our findings from the viewpoint 312 of pathophysiological mechanisms. One potential mechanism underlying the association 313 between pneumonia and cardiovascular events is inflammation [37]. Specifically, the 314 inflammatory reaction following pneumonia can result in plaque instability and damage in 315 the blood vessels. Evidence of elevated local inflammation in the atherosclerotic coronary 316 arteries following acute systemic infections has been shown in many studies [37][39]. Thus, 317 infections may result in heightened loading that is imposed on cardiomyocytes and lead to 318 sympathetic hyperactivity or ischemia, which may increase the risk of arrhythmia and heart 319 failure in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing CHD [36]. 320 Given the limited understanding of the prognostic factors for COVID-19, more 321 research, including potentially prospective studies, is needed to investigate the mechanism by 322 which pre-existing CHD may influence the survival probability of patients with COVID-19. 323 From the clinical point of view, early evaluation of a patient's medical history is necessary to 324 implement early medical interventions and decrease the mortality risk. We suggest 325 monitoring the dynamic heart rate for patients with pre-existing CHD. For those severe 326 symptomatic patients who had pre-existing heart ischemia and abnormal heart function, early 327 medical intervention may be needed [40]. 328 Furthermore, our results indicated that the risk of death from COVID-19 was 329 significantly higher in older patients. Adjusting for others, every 1-year increase in age was 330 associated with a 4% increased risk of death, which is similar to what was found in previous 331 studies [8][9], [16]. Alongside the evidence of prognostic risk in CHD, we suggest that extra 332 care is needed for those with CHD, especially for elderly patients.

            "text": "Previous studies yielded mixed results regarding gender differences in mortality risk 334 of COVID-19. Some studies found male sex was associated with a higher risk of death from 335 COVID-19[41], whereas other studies did not find gender to be a significant factor 336 predicting the mortality risk of COVID-19[10],[16]. In the current study, gender was not a 337 significant mortality risk factor for COVID-19. More research is needed to further our 338 understanding of gender differences in the outcome of COVID-19 and underlying 339 mechanisms.340Thedesign of excluding patients from Hubei Province was based on the concerns of 341 unknown confounders caused by insufficient medical resources in the epicenter. CDC's 342 report has pointed out that the rapidly increasing number of infections could easily crash the 343 health care system by exceeding its maximum capacity [42]. Therefore, analyzing patient 344 data outside of Hubei Province avoided the competing mortality risk caused by insufficient 345 health care resources and revealed the true underlying impact of pre-existing comorbidities 346 on COVID-19 mortality [43]. 347 This study has several limitations. It is worth noting that the data were collected when 348 COVID-19 was spreading rapidly in China and the health authorities and researchers had 349 limited understanding of the incubation period, modes of viral transmission, and effective 350 treatment. Whether our findings can be generalized to later epidemic phases warrants future 351 research. One limitation of the present study lies in the nature of publicly reported data. 352 Researchers have pointed out that severe cases may be overrepresented in publicly reported 353 data [44]. Nevertheless, we have managed to reduce the potential bias caused by severe case 354 overrepresentation by appropriately matching the cases and controls in the NCC design.355 Following the NCC design, we allowed the controls to be matched with cases on age 1 \u00b1 356 year old instead of the exact matching, which caused the significant age difference between 357 two groups(Table 1). Thus, we adjusted for the matching covariates in all the models to 358 address this[31]. The auto-matching procedure via the statistical program also prevented the 359 possibility of tendentiously selecting survivors with comorbidity-free history during data 360 collection. In addition, NCC design is favored in our situation where the risk factor data and 361 event of interest can be identified opportunistically from publicly reported confirmed cases 362[30]. Therefore, NCC was the optimal choice, given the restricted availability of public data. 363 Moreover, due to the lack of information of treatment in the health reports published by the 364 local health commission websites, we did not include treatment information into analysis, 365 which may produce confounding effects. It calls for future research to investigate the 366 mortality risk effect of pre-existing comorbidities by adding treatment as a covariate in thePage 12 of 26 For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open",

Based 372 on our findings, close monitoring, extra care, and early medical intervention are needed for 373 patients with pre-existing CHD to reduce the mortality risk associated with COVID-19.
