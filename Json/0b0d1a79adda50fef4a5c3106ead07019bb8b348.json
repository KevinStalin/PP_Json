Older age and the presence of comorbidities, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and obesity, have been reported to be risk factors for progression of pulmonary disease as well as for death [3, 4] .",

The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) timely devised expert statements and practical guidance for the nutritional management of patients with COVID-19 [5] . These guidelines recommend that nutritional intervention and therapy be considered as an integral part of the approach to these patients. Indeed, as for any acute and chronic disease, optimal nutritional care associated to life-support therapy has potential to improve the outcome of patients affected by this life-threatening disease, including better and shorter recovery from the acute phase. However, up to now none of the papers reporting epidemiology, clinical features and outcome of COVID-19 cohorts has described the patient nutritional status and nutritional therapy [1, 3, 6] , excepting the observation of a poorer prognosis in patients with high body mass index [7] .",

This reduced the chances of contact with the patients for reasons other than life-saving diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Therefore, estimated/referred BW was used to calculate the BMI in around one-half of the patient cohort, whereas only the one-month non-volitional weight loss could be recorded. A one-day intake of the prescribed HD was used to surrogate the last week's food intake in comparison with energy requirement and no technique for the body composition assessment was applied, to measure the muscle mass. Indeed, even though the estimation of BW and height is a method used also in the methods of the ESPEN NutritionDay audit [15] , it doesn't allow to evaluate the change in body composition/hydration related to ongoing pathophysiological mechanisms of malnutrition, nor to detect reduced food intake or inflammation-related catabolism, as well as to have a precise calculation of the energy expenditure [16] .

In patients in IMCUs and RUs, both the prescribed and actual energy intake were near to the lowest limit of the range of the ESPEN recommendations, whereas the protein intake was within the range. In patients in ICUs, the actual energy intake was near to the 100% of the BEE, whereas the protein intake appeared below the recommendations. In the whole cohort of patients, the actual oral intake was lower than 75% of the prescribed intake in two-thirds of patients and lower than 50% in 40% of them. As expected, the oral intake was adversely affected by the impairment of appetite, the invasiveness of the O 2 -therapy and the presence of frailty/disability. These observations indicate the need to take actions to implement the daily monitoring of the degree of disease/inflammation burden and the oral intake with its causative factors, and to plan tailored nutritional therapy [5, 17] . This is highlighted by the data on serum albumin concentration. In COVID-19 patients developing ARDS, decreased serum albumin, and prealbumin concentrations were described [3] . Even though in acute inflammatory stage, serum albumin should be considered a supportive proxy measure of inflammation rather than of nutritional status [10] , the positive association we found between serum albumin and protein and energy intake supports the need to provide the recommended amounts [5] . ESPEN guidelines recommend routine assessment of nutritional risk and nutritional status, nutrient intake and inflammation-related catabolism as well as timely and appropriate nutritional therapy in all the hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [5] .

More than one-half of patients were males and 70.9% were older than 64 years. Around one-half (43.6%) had ARDS, and 15.0% were on CPAP/NIV, ETI or TMV O 2 -therapy. Three-fourths (74.6%) of patients had one or more co-morbidities. Patients in SICUs and in ICUs settings showed the highest percentages of overweight and obesity and the most severe clinical feature, as represented by the lowest percentages of normal PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio and the use of CPAP/NIV and invasive type of O 2 -therapy.

All these factors could have caused an underestimation of the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f prevalence of malnutrition, since it was diagnosed in only 54% of patients who were at nutritional risk. The strength of the study is the observation of a large cohort of patients that was representative of all the clinical features of COVID-19 disease, hospitalized in four levels of intensive care settings in a tertiary university hospital of Northern Italy, one of the most affected areas in Europe. The clinical characteristics of the patient cohort agreed with those reported in the literature: more than one-half were males, two-thirds were older than 64 years, one-half were overweight or obese and each co-morbidity affected at least 20% of the patients. These characteristics were more evident in patients in SICUs or ICUs settings, who were younger (those in ICUs), had greater BMI and the most severe clinical feature, as represented by the lowest PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio, the higher CRP serum concentrations, and the more invasive type of O 2 -therapy.The prevalence of malnutrition as well as its current mechanisms differed among the intensity of care settings, where the patients were managed according to the severity and the stage of the disease. The GLIM guidelines suggest that the serum CRP concentration could be used as a criterion to evaluate the presence and the severity of disease/inflammation burden, but no indications on how to categorize and use it are given[10]. We calculated the prevalence of malnutrition, including either all the categories of disease/inflammation or only the moderatesevere categories. Patients in ICUs showed the highest prevalence (70%) of both nutritional risk and malnutrition. Malnutrition affected one-half of patients in both IMCUs and RUs when all the categories of inflammation/catabolism were considered. When only moderate-severe inflammation/catabolism were included, the prevalence of malnutrition decreased to one-third of patients in IMCUs and to only in 6% of those in RUs. These data are in keeping with the different stage of the disease in patients hospitalized in these two settings: early and acute stage in IMCUs and late and chronic stage in RUs, represented by the higher CRP levels in IMCUs and the longer LOHS in RUs.",
