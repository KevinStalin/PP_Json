We used \u03b2-coefficient multiplied by 10 and rounded to the nearest multiple of 2 derived from the logistic regression model to generate a screening score to ascertain the probability of COVID-19 in patients aged\u226515 years considering a combination of clinical signs and epidemiological features. The performance of the model was assessed by ROC curve. The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were estimated for each cutoff. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 14.0 (StataCorp, LP). We collected data on 3154 patients. Overall characteristics and comparison between patients with negative and positive PCR results among those symptomatic were detailed in can be obtained with a cut-off point of 30 but with a Se of 34.4%. A cut-off of 34 will provide a LR+ of at least 5 which can be considered red flags according to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f commonly arbitrary definition (Struyf et al. 2020) . The area under the ROC curve was 0.7723 (95%CI: 0.75-0.79). The internal validation using 1000 bootstrap samples from the original dataset found a ROC curve area of 0.7614.",

However, availability, access and affordability of blood tests limit their use in resource-limited settings. A trade-off between sensitivity and specificity is challenging when considering screening tool for suspect cases. Nevertheless, more sensitive tool is often needed and preferred in an ongoing outbreak. A recent systematic review of signs and symptoms in COVID-19 showed low sensitivity of these signs when taken separately (Struyf et al. 2020) . A recent study in Somalia showed that the current WHO case definition for COVID-19 had only 32.7% (95%CI: 20-48) sensitivity that could be slightly improved when integrating anosmia in the case definition (Ahmed et al. 2020) . Anosmia and ageusia are highly specific of COVID-19 and have the highest scores in the model even if they were present in only 27.3% and 16.2% of patients (La Torre et al., 2020; Liou et al., 2020) . Surprisingly, dyspnoea was not associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 test and was associated with negative test in univariate analysis. Similarly, self-reported contact with confirmed case did not help discriminate SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.",
