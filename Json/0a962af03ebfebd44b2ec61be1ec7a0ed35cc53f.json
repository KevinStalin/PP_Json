To understand viral disease biology, we have carried out proteo-genomic analysis using next generation sequencing (NGS) and massspectrometry on nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID-19 patients to examine clinical genome and proteome. Our study confirms the hyper mutability of SARS-CoV-2 showing multiple SNPs. NGS analysis detected 27 mutations of which 14 are synonymous, 11 are missense and 2 are extragenic in nature. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates indicated their close relation to Bangladesh isolate and multiple origins of isolates within a country. Our proteomic analysis, for the first time identified 13 different SARS-CoV-2 proteins from the clinical swabs. Of the total 41 peptides captured by HRMS, 8 matched to nucleocapsid protein, 2 to ORF9b, 1 to spike glycoprotein and ORF3a, with remaining mapping to ORF1ab polyprotein. Additionally, host proteome analysis revealed several key host proteins to be uniquely expressed in COVID-19",

Though they are important for effective immune response, they can also be cytotoxic and lead to hyperinflammation through degranulation and lysis during severe pneumonia. [28] [29] [30] With increasing studies showing upregulated neutrophil genes and neutrophilattracting chemokines in SARS-CoV-2, current literature also showed their role in damaging host inflammatory responses through involvement of NETs and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte .

We observed that number of peptides identified did not always correlate with Ct values in the RT-PCR test. ORF10 protein still remains elusive though data showed its role in ubiquitination; its expression in clinical swabs is still a question mark.In comparison to RNA, proteins are more stable and better candidates for diagnosis. Proteinscan be better reflective of virus load and disease. A greater number of peptides identified in sample may indicate greater viral load and proliferation, with samples showing maximum peptides could reflect severity of the disease.

The clinical landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and host proteome highlighted correlation between the viral proteins and host responses (Figure 5). Through our proteomics study, we confirmed expression of various(13 in    this study) viral proteins in the host cell. Pathway analysis of host proteome indicated enrichment of proteins majorly involved in immune response, metabolism and RNA processing. We identified several COVID-19 peptides within a 90 min MS-acquisition window, few of which are unique to SARS-CoV-2 and not present in other coronaviruses, confirming SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our study suggests the importance of SARS-CoV-2 specific peptide LVDPQIQLAVTR (Orf9b) and IFTIGTVTLKQGEIK (Orf3a) in its accurate detection. Though more studies can further deepen the understanding of viral biopathology, this study offers both proteo-genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 confirming high rate of mutation in Indian isolates and expression of viral protein (Orf9b) in the host cell, which suppresses the host innate immune response. Enrichment of proteins involved in neutrophils mediated immune response pointed towards the crosstalk between host and pathogen. Our study highlighted the potential of mass-spectrometry as a specific and sensitive diagnostic tool and laid down the foundation for future studies.
