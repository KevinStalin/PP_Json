Indeed, ACE2 receptor is expressed in the liver cells, particularly in the bile duct epithelial cells, and this might favor viral entry and cause liver damage [1] . Previous studies are reassuring as far as susceptibility of immunosuppressed pediatric patients to the infection and the disease showing that, among children in the follow-up for liver transplantation and autoimmune liver disease, none developed a severe clinical pulmonary disease, despite some tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, due to the absence of published studies, it is still unclear whether children with different etiologies of chronic liver disease (CLD) are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

These results are different from what reported in adult studies where some subgroups of patients (with cirrhosis, NASH or liver cancer) have been found to be at increased risk for severe COVID-19, and have poorer prognosis [13, 15] . Of interest, in our cohort, all symptomatic patients developed only mild/moderate respiratory symptoms not requiring hospitalization nor oxygen therapy. Furthermore, 2 patients with confirmed COVID-19 remained asymptomatic despite they had a CLD complicated by PH (in both patients) and cirrhosis (in 1). These results show that children with CLD 3 and COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or have a mild course of disease, similarly to what reported in the general pediatric population [1] [2] [3] [4] .",
