However, this digitalization comes with the challenge of acquiring, scrutinizing, and applying that knowledge to solve complex clinical problems [1]. This motivates the use of AI, because it can handle large volumes of data with enhanced automation [2] . AI is a technology-based system involving various advanced tools and networks that can mimic human intelligence. At the same time, it does not threaten to replace human physical presence [3, 4] completely. AI utilizes systems and software that can interpret and learn from the input data to make independent decisions for accomplishing specific objectives. Its applications are continuously being extended in the pharmaceutical field, as described in this review. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, the rapid advances in AI-guided automation will be likely to completely change the work culture of society [5, 6] .",

ML uses algorithms that can recognize patterns within a set of data that has been further classified. A subfield of the ML is deep learning (DL), which engages artificial neural networks (ANNs). These comprise a set of interconnected sophisticated computing elements involving 'perceptons' analogous to human biological neurons, mimicking the transmission of electrical impulses in the human brain [7] . ANNs constitute a set of nodes, each receiving a separate input, ultimately converting them to output, either singly or multi-linked using algorithms to solve problems [8] . ANNs involve various types, including multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which utilize either supervised or unsupervised training procedures [9, 10] .",

The data sets available for drug development in pharmaceutical companies can involve millions of compounds, and traditional ML tools might not be able to deal with these types of data. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)-based computational model can quickly predict large numbers of compounds or simple physicochemical parameters, such as log P or log D. However, these models are some way from the predictions of complex biological properties, such as the efficacy and adverse effects of compounds. In addition, QSARbased models also face problems such as small training sets, experimental data error in training sets, and lack of experimental validations. To overcome these challenges, recently developed AI approaches, such as DL and relevant modeling studies, can be implemented for safety and efficacy evaluations of drug molecules based on big data modeling and analysis. In 2012, Merck supported a QSAR ML challenge to observe the advantages of DL in the drug discovery process in the pharmaceutical industry. DL models showed significant predictivity compared with traditional ML approaches for 15 absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) data sets of drug candidates [21, 22] .",

On similar lines, RF and DNN-based in silico models were developed to determine human intestinal absorption of a variety of chemical compounds [41] . Thus, AI has a significant role in the development of a drug, to predict not only its desired physicochemical properties, but also the desired bioactivity. Prediction of bioactivity The efficacy of drug molecules depends on their affinity for the target protein or receptor. Drug molecules that do not show any interaction or affinity towards the targeted protein will not be able to deliver the therapeutic response. In some instances, it might also be possible that developed drug molecules interact with unintended proteins or receptors, leading to toxicity. Hence, drug target binding affinity (DTBA) is vital to predict drug-target interactions. AI-based methods can measure the binding affinity of a drug by considering either the features or similarities of the drug and its target. Feature-based interactions recognize the chemical moieties of the drug and that of the target to determine the feature vectors. By contrast, in similarity-based interaction, the similarity between drug and target is considered, and it is assumed that similar drugs will interact with the same targets [42] .",

DeepAffinity is an interpretable DL model that uses both RNN and CNN and both unlabeled and labeled data. It takes into account the compound in the SMILES format and protein sequences in the structural and physicochemical properties [47] . PADME is a DL-based platform that utilizes feed-forward neural networks for predicting drug target interactions (DTIs). It considers the combination of the features of the drug and target protein as input data and forecasts the interaction strength between the two. For the drug and the target, the SMILES representation and the protein sequence composition (PSC) are used for illustration, respectively [46] . Unsupervised ML techniques, such as MANTRA and PREDICT, can be used to forecast the therapeutic efficacy of drugs and target proteins of known and unknown pharmaceuticals, which can also be extrapolated to the application of drug repurposing and interpreting the molecular mechanism of the therapeutics. MANTRA groups compound based on similar gene expression profiles using a CMap data set and clusters those compounds predicted to have a common mechanism of action and common biological pathway [43] . The bioactivity of a drug also includes ADME data. AIbased tools, such as XenoSite, FAME, and SMARTCyp, are involved in determining the sites of metabolism of the drug. In addition, software such as CypRules, MetaSite, MetaPred, SMARTCyp, and WhichCyp were used to identify specific isoforms of CYP450 that mediate a particular drug metabolism. The clearance pathway of 141 approved drugs was done by SVM-based predictors with high accuracy [48] . Prediction of toxicity The prediction of the toxicity of any drug molecule is vital to avoid toxic effects. Cell-based in vitro assays are often used as preliminary studies, followed by animal studies to identify the toxicity of a compound, increasing the expense of drug discovery. Several web-based tools, such as LimTox, pkCSM, admetSAR, and Toxtree, are available to help reduce the cost [35] . Advanced AI-based approaches look for similarities among compounds or project the toxicity of the compound based on input features. The Tox21 Data Challenge organized by the National Institutes of Health, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was an initiative to evaluate several computational techniques to forecast the toxicity of 12 707 environmental compounds and drugs [35] ; an ML algorithm named DeepTox outperformed all methods by identifying static and dynamic features within the chemical descriptors of the molecules, such as molecular weight (MW) and Van der Waals volume, and could efficiently predict the toxicity of a molecule based on predefined 2500 toxicophore features.

The 'Guilt by association' approach can be utilized to forecast the innovative association of a drug and disease, which is either a knowledge-based or computationally driven network [64] . In a computationally driven network, the ML approach is widely used, which utilizes techniques such as SVM, NN, logistic regression, and DL.

This platform uses DNN trained with ~14 000 bioactivity data points developed based on >300 kinases. Thus, it has practical application in studying the overall selectivity of a drug towards the kinase family and particular subfamilies of kinases, thus helping to design novel chemical modifiers. This study used NVP-BHG712 as a model compound to predict its primary targets and also its off-targets with reasonable accuracy [71] . One prominent instance is Cyclica's cloud-based proteome-screening AI platform, Ligand Express, which is used to find receptors that can interact with a particular small molecule (the molecular description of which is in SMILE string) and produce on and off-target interactions. This helps in understanding the possible adverse effects of the drug [72] . AI in de novo drug design Over the past few years, the de novo drug design approach has been widely used to design drug molecules. The traditional method of de novo drug design is being replaced by evolving DL methods, the former having shortcomings of complicated synthesis routes and difficult prediction of the bioactivity of the novel molecule [36] . Computer-aided synthesis planning can also suggest millions of structures that can be synthesized and also predicts several different synthesis routes for them [73] . [74] , now renamed Synthia, which has the ability to encode a set of rules into the machine and propose possible synthesizing routes for eight medicinally essential targets. This program has proven to be efficient both in terms of improving the yield and reducing expenses. It is also capable of providing alternate synthesizing strategies for patented products and is said to be helpful in the synthesis of compounds that have not yet been synthesized. Similarly, DNN focuses on rules of organic chemistry and retrosynthesis, which, with the aid of Monte-Carlo tree searches and symbolic AI, help in reaction prediction and the process of drug discovery and design, which is much faster than traditional methods [75, 76] .",
