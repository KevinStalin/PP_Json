We first estimated c7dGTP for its efficiency in PCR amplification and its resistance to three restriction enzymes, AluI, HaeIII, and HpyCH4V. We then evaluated TEEDseq using a serum sample spiked with a 1311-bp hepatitis B virus (HBV) fragment. TEEDseq achieved an HBV on-target rate of 3.31 \u00b1 0.39%, which was equivalent to 454\u00d7 the enrichment of direct Illumina sequencing. Therefore, the current study has provided a concept proof for TEEDseq as an alternative option for clinical viral sequencing that requires an enrichment in next-generation sequencing.",

            "text": "In current clinical viral genome sequencing, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a frequent choice that provides an unbiased high resolution of mutation profile in a genome-wide manner [1] . Because of an overwhelming dominance of human genetic content in clinical specimens, a major limitation of this approach is its low efficiency, which is rarely higher than 1% of viral sequencing reads in NGS output [1] . Among numerous virusenriched methods, capture sequencing, employing a hybridization step after NGS library construction, comes out as the most efficient strategy to enrich viral sequences [1] . However, this strategy is associated with a dramatic cost increase as it requires the synthesis of expensive biotin labeled virus-specific probes (baits) and streptavidin beads [2] . The inclusion of such a hybridization step after initial library preparation also makes the entire NGS pipeline a lengthy procedure. Most human viruses, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), HIV, and coronavirus, have a genome less than 30 kb in size. If the viral on-target rate consistently exceeds 1%, current NGS approach is actually powerful enough to satisfy clinical and research needs. For instance, a 1% HCV ontarget rate in 5 million of 2 \u00d7 150 bp paired ended reads give a depth at 1562\u00d7, which already crosses a saturation point (1100\u00d7) for HCV viral population dissection with a mutation frequency resolved at 1% [3] . To achieve this goal, we provide an alternative option for viral sequence enrichment that does not require a probe-based hybridization step. Our method, named NGS with target enrichment via enzymatic digestion (TEEDseq), is dependent on 7-deaza-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (c 7 dGTP), an analog of deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP). Due to its ability to relax DNA secondary structure, c 7 dGTP is widely used in PCR and Sanger sequencing [4, 5] . DNA molecules composed of c 7 dGTP show steric alteration that is resistant to some restriction enzymes with the recognition motifs containing guanosine [6] . This unique characteristic of c 7 dGTP is used to accomplish the enrichment of a sequencing target.",

Consequently, both single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and doublestrand DNA (dsDNA) were generated and used for the digestion of three restriction enzymes (AluI, HaeIII, and HpyCH4V) (NEB) that were carefully selected based on their recognition motifs and buffer compatibility. The experiment was repeated with PCR amplicon generated using c 7 dGTP.

TEEDseq reached an enrichment 454\u00d7 that of direct sequencing (option c). The recovery of HBV-mapped reads was 12.6 times higher in option a than in option b, illustrating the pivotal role of the three restriction enzymes. Using HiCUP [14] , these enzymes together have 36,535,384 cuts (AluI 13,085,321; HaeIII 8,582,925; HpyCH4V 14,867,138) on the human genome Fig. 1 HBV-specific read mapping among four options. Read-alignment on 1195-bp HBV genome sequence from the HBVR4 priming site was viewed in bam file using BamView [13] . Reads with matching start and end positions were collapsed into one line and are shown in green. Option a, b, and c used a serum sample spiked with 1311-bp HBV fragment. Option d had no HBV fragment spiked in the serum and served as a control. Each option was shown with the numbers (average and standard derivation) of HBV-mapped and total reads from three technical replicates after the quality control (building GRCh38). Their combination with exonucleases efficiently digested non-target background sequences.",

Using a serum sample spiked with a partial HBV genome (1311 bp), TEEDseq achieved a 3.31% mapping rate. Under a probe-based hybridization strategy, genome-wide HBV capture sequencing does not necessarily have a high on-target rate, for instance, < 1% in a recent report [15] . Off-target effect may come from non-specific priming since there is significant microhomology between HBV and the human genome [16] . A more rigid primer design and conditions for primer extension could further enhance the enrichment.",

            "text": "In addition, TEEDseq has several technical features worthy of attention. Serum DNA is regarded as a lowbiomass sample. Its low DNA concentration, 435 ng/mL in the current study, naturally favors intracellular ligation that can be further facilitated using a splinter. Because intermolecular ligation is suppressed at a low DNA concentration, high concentration of templates, such as DNA extracted from tissue samples, need to be diluted prior to the ligation [17] . Second, we applied two-phase RCA amplification, target-specific and non-specific. The short incubation of non-specific RCA suppresses the amplification of contaminated sequences in the reagents, as observed in our recent studies [18, 19] . Third, TEEDseq requires purification after primer extension. Afterwards, ligation, digestion, and RCA do not need purification because all enzymes have optimal activity in the Cut-Smart buffer (NEB). Therefore, these reactions can be conducted successively in the same tube. Finally, phi29 DNA polymerase used in RCA has a strong standdisplacement activity. This activity results in a hyperbranched structure of the final product that usually has a large size more than 10 kb [20] . Therefore, the final product can be directly used for fragmentation in NGS library preparation without the need of additional procedure, such as concatemerization. Taken together, our experiment, using a partial HBV genome (1311 bp) spiked in a serum sample, provides concept evidence that TEEDseq is a simple and cost-effective method for target enrichment in NGS. By using multiple primers to cover target genomes in primer extension, it can be applied to clinical viral sequencing as well as human genomic research.",
