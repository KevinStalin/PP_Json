This study aimed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on manual therapy service utilization within the Australian private healthcare setting during the first half of 2020. Quarterly data regarding the number and total cost of services provided were extracted for each manual therapy profession (i.e., chiropractic, osteopathy, and physiotherapy) for the period January 2015 to June 2020 from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Time series forecasting methods were used to estimate absolute and relative differences between the forecasted and observed values of service utilization. An estimated 1.3 million (13.2%) fewer manual therapy services, with a total cost of AUD 84 million, were provided within the Australian private healthcare setting during the first half of 2020. Reduction in service utilization was considerably larger in the second quarter (21.7%) than in the first quarter (5.7%), and was larger in physiotherapy (20.6%) and osteopathy (12.7%) than in chiropractic (5.2%). The impact varied across states and territories, with the largest reductions in service utilization observed in New South Wales (17.5%), Australian Capital Territory (16.3%), and Victoria (16.2%). The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on manual therapy service utilization in Australia. The magnitude of the decline in service utilization varied considerably across professions and locations. The long-term consequences of this decline in manual therapy utilization remain to be determined.",

Studies have documented increased utilization of manual therapy services over time in Australia, albeit with diverging trends across professions [11, 12] . It has been estimated that approximately 21.6 million manual therapy services with a total cost of AUD 1.4 billion were provided within the Australian private healthcare setting annually in the period between 2013 and 2017, which represented a significant increase from the preceding five-year period [12] .

We also extracted quarterly data on the estimated number of persons covered under private health insurance general treatment cover. A pyramid plot of the number of persons insured by sex and age group in 2020 Q2 is provided in Section A of the Supplementary Materials ( Figure S1 ). Statistics on registered healthcare practitioners are available from the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and each profession's registration board [8] [9] [10] 14] . For this study, we extracted quarterly data on the number of registered providers from each manual therapy profession from 2015 Q1 to 2020 Q2. We did not include registrants listed as limited or non-practicing. We then estimated the number of providers working in the private sector for each profession as follows: For chiropractic and osteopathy, 100% of registrants were taken to be working in the private sector because neither of these professions contribute to service provision in the public sector. For physiotherapy, 63.5% of registrants were taken to be working in the private sector, as estimated by a National Health Workforce Report [15] .",

During the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic coincided with approximately 1.3 million fewer chiropractic, osteopathy, and physiotherapy services provided within the Australian private healthcare system. The associated loss of revenue was estimated to be AUD 84 million. Physiotherapy incurred the largest relative reduction in service provision and revenue, while chiropractic was found to be the least impacted of the three manual therapy professions.

It is not unexpected to observe disruption of health services during a global pandemic. While much of the initial disruption of health services has been characterized by the surge in demand for front-line care of COVID-19 patients, there has also been a concomitant reduction in or discontinuation of prevention and rehabilitation services for noncommunicable diseases. For instance, the World Health Organization reported that more than half of the countries surveyed had partially or completely disrupted services for the treatment or clinical management of hypertension, diabetes and diabetes-related complications, cancer, and cardiovascular emergencies [18] . A similar situation exists in Australia, where there have been marked reductions in a wide range of health services, including breast and prostate cancer screenings [19, 20] , pediatric orthopedic hospital services [21] , trauma care in Emergency Departments [22, 23] , and initiation of cardiopulmonary resuscitation by Emergency Medical Services in public areas [24] . It is important to note that our findings encompass only the initial disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. It remains to be determined whether the decline in manual therapy service utilization persists beyond the first half of 2020, whether manual therapy service utilization returns to pre-pandemic levels after the virus has been eliminated, and whether economic factors such as sustained or transient changes in disposable income, uptake of private health insurance, and cost of services have any lasting effects on healthcare-seeking behavior and manual therapy service utilization. Future studies are encouraged to explore these unresolved questions.",

            "text": "The magnitude of the decline in manual therapy service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic was not uniform across the three professions, with physiotherapy and chiropractic experiencing the largest and smallest relative reductions, respectively. The exact reason for this difference is unclear, but it may be related to differences in revenue streams (e.g., proportion derived from private health insurance) and patient characteristics (e.g., level of disposable income) across the three professions [12] . For instance, as the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded and loss of income became more prevalent in the population, perhaps Australians have forfeited their private health insurance with general treatment cover as a cost-saving measure. While this explanation may sound reasonable given the circumstances, it does not explain why there was a larger decline in physiotherapy service utilization relative to chiropractic and osteopathy. Nor does it explain the fact that the results from our supplementary analyses of service utilization per 100,000 insured persons were very similar to our main findings, which suggests that any changes in the number of insured persons are unlikely to explain the observed differences. An alternative explanation may be differences in case-mix across the three manual therapy professions. Although this explanation is not supported by the scope of practice of the three professions, which all state that they diagnose and treat musculoskeletal conditions, industry reports indicate that physiotherapy provides more specialized services (e.g., neurological rehabilitation, geriatric services, and sports injury prevention and rehabilitation) than osteopathy and chiropractic [25, 26] . Thus, it is conceivable that public health orders and social restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., stay-at-home directives, limited access to aged care facilities, and shutdown of community sport activities) may have resulted in a marked reduction in utilization of specialist physiotherapy services. Although this may explain the larger relative reduction in physiotherapy service utilization (20.6%), it does not adequately explain the differences in relative reduction in services between osteopathy (12.7%) and chiropractic (5.2%). Further research is needed to examine the factors influencing healthcare-seeking behavior and manual therapy service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic and to elucidate the underlying reasons for the observed differences across the three manual therapy professions.",

More importantly, we applied sophisticated analytical techniques to produce forecasts that account for both seasonal variation and long-term trends across professions and geographical regions (i.e., states and territories). In an attempt to account for changes in the number of providers and people with private health insurance, we provided supplementary analyses using secondary outcome variables (i.e., number and total cost of services provided per provider and per 100,000 persons with private health insurance). These supplementary analyses produced very similar estimates of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on manual therapy service utilization.
