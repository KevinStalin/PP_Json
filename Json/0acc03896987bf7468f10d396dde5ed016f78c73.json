The Austrian government initiated a nationwide lockdown on 16 March 2020, which involved people only being allowed to leave their homes for specific reasons such as going to work, necessary purchases, assisting people, and limited activities outside, alone or only accompanied by people living in the same household. Such a lockdown raised the immediate concern that some people may be harmed by not having access to treatment. Indeed, the Austrian lockdown resulted in a 40 % decline nationwide of acute coronary syndrome admissions to Austrian hospitals [9] .

A decline in hospital admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic has now been observed in many countries including China, Canada, and several European countries [10] . It is not clear whether people stay at home with various diseases that require treatment or, in contrast, whether a change in lifestyle during lockdown, including social distancing, results in less disease. As we did not have information on the severity of GI bleeding, we can only speculate on whether a greater proportion of patients with less severe bleeding events chose not to attend hospital for endoscopic procedures.",

Stress-related factors may be a significant cause of peptic ulcer disease in intensive care situations [12] . It is possible that modern medicine over recent years has rather ignored the fact that lifestyle and stress-related factors might contribute to upper GI disorders including peptic ulcer disease [13] . Importantly, our data showed that nonvariceal bleeding events in particular declined, and this would support the hypothesis that stress-related factors that promote peptic ulcer disease could have also played a role. Variceal bleeding constitutes less than 10 % of acute upper GI bleeding and was not affected by lockdown. Alcoholic liver disease is also a leading cause of liver cirrhosis in Austria, and lockdown might result in increased consumption of alcohol. Importantly, alcohol consumption is a well-known risk factor for variceal bleeding [14] . Some caveats require discussion. As a consequence of lockdown, endoscopy units have performed substantially fewer examinations, focusing only on emergency and highly urgent procedures. We cannot rule out the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic has also influenced gastroenterologists' decision making, with endoscopy being used more defensively and less sick patients with only suspicion of upper GI bleeding not undergoing endoscopy [15] . Although many hospitals responded to our survey, a response bias could also have played a role, as 39 % of all Austrian hospitals, especially smaller ones, did not respond. Despite these potential confounding factors, our data clearly support the notion that lockdown resulted in a dramatic decline in acute upper GI bleedings in hospitals nationwide.",
