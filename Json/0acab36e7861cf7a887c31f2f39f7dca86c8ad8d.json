This study examined the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the ease of access to essential medicines by end users. A cross-sectional survey using electronic questionnaires was conducted on study participants across the 36 states of Nigeria. They were assessed on sociodemographics, health characteristics, and challenges in accessing essential medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data obtained were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 20, IBM, Armonk, NY) with overall impact of the pandemic operationalized as < 60.0% or \u00b3 60.0% access to essential medicines by respondents as maximal and minimal impact, respectively. The results showed that 35.2% of the respondents managing chronic illnesses had difficulties accessing essential medicines during the COVID-19 lockdown, with 84.0% experiencing deteriorating chronic health conditions in the light of difficulty in accessing their medicines. The proportion of respondents who sourced for orthodox medicines before COVID-19 lockdown (98.4%) was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than that of those who sourced for the same during the lockdown (89.0%). Increase in cost of medicines was observed by 77.7% of participants, with 73.9% of respondents living with chronic illness affirming that their income was negatively affected by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic had minimal impact on consumers' ability to access essential medicines. However, important challenges identified were poor availability of means of transportation, reduced income, and high cost of medicines, as well as fear of contracting the virus.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2. 1 It is an ongoing global pandemic first discovered in Wuhan, China, in 2019. 2, 3 The WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020 and later characterized COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. 4,5 There are more than 11.3 million cases reported in more than 188 countries as of July 2020, with more than 531,000 deaths and 6.11 million recoveries. 6 The emergence of COVID-19 has affected the economy globally by directly affecting production in key countries that are sole manufacturers of raw materials, intermediate products, and consumer goods, thereby creating supply chain and market disruption, and by its financial impact on firms and the financial markets. 7 Essential medicines are those drugs that satisfy the priority healthcare needs of the population. 8 As a result of the surge in the pandemic, which led to the inevitable lockdown of the economy across affected countries, there has been a noticeable decrease in production and exportation of raw materials as well as finished products (drugs) across different countries. These greatly affected the ease of access to these medicines by the consumers who need them either for treating acute ailments or for the management of chronic diseases. Most developing countries are in their early stages of pharmaceutical development; thus, they rely on importation of drugs, raw materials, and equipment from countries outside the region, notably India and China. 9 Nigeria is highly dependent on other countries for its medicinal needs. About 70.0% of the medicines used in Nigeria and most other African countries are imported from China and India. 10 Nigeria as a developing country is faced with the challenge of a weak healthcare system and inefficient drug supply chain management; this has been a major concern in the treatment of diseases and a major hindrance to the attainment of the universal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aim to ensure healthy lives and well-being for all. Access to medicine is an important component of good healthcare systems, and with uninterrupted access to medicine, improving the health outcome of the population is likely to be achieved. 11 In Nigeria, the lockdown which was accompanied with the closure of borders and travel ban across states led to a significant drop in the quantity of essential medicines in the health facilities, making it difficult for consumers to get the medicines they need. The COVID-19 pandemic also caused an increase in the prices of medicines, hand sanitizers, face masks, personal protective equipment, and other medical equipment used for providing health care. 12 This study therefore aims to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to essential medicines in Nigeria by end users.",

Questionnaire for the study was developed in several stages of drafts and reviews, guided by the literature and in consultation with specialists and experts in survey research. Pretest of the drafted questionnaire was undertaken among 15 respondents from the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria to examine face validity, readability, and comprehensibility. The final questionnaire has sections on the demographic and health characteristics of the respondents and a COVID-19 impact assessment. 14 A link to the electronic questionnaire was shared to respondents across the 36 states of Nigeria using social media platforms, specifically WhatsApp and Facebook, because they form a suitable platform for disseminating information in Nigeria. 15 We used the services of our social media networks to help distribute the questionnaires to their own networks so as to get more respondents. Data for the study were collected between May and June 2020. A total of 374 respondents completed and returned informed consent along with the questionnaire electronically. 16 Data analysis. Data were coded and abstracted into the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and thereafter loaded into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20 for final analysis. Simple descriptive analysis including frequencies and percentages was computed for demographic characteristics. We operationalized the respondents as those managing acute or chronic illnesses. Because this research was a national study, results were analyzed holistically, and thereafter relevant comparisons were made across the six geopolitical zones. First, the McNemar test was used to determine the differences between the sources of medication \"before and during\" the lockdown. It was also applied to determine the differences between difficulty of accessing essential medicines \"before and during the lockdown.\" Sources of medicines were dichotomized as \"orthodox medicines\" (essential medicines from hospitals, pharmacies, and patent medicine shops) and \"alternative therapy\" (essential medicines from herbal sources and no use of medicines) before McNemar's test. Determination of ease of access to essential medicines among the different categories of illnesses (acute and chronic conditions). Difficulty of accessing medicine to worsening of chronic condition, increase in cost of medicine for acute and chronic conditions and across geopolitical zones, and, finally, impact of COVID-19 on the income of respondents was performed using chi-square test of independence and Fisher's exact test, respectively. All statistical analyses were twosided, with statistical significance defined at P < 0.05. Although the UN Sustainable Development Goal 3 envisions access to medicines by everyone, in this study, we operationalized minimum impact as 60.0% of the population being able to access medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, percentages less than 60.0% were considered as maximal impact on access to essential medicines, whereas percentages greater than that were considered as minimal impact.",

Findings of this research demonstrated a minimum impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Nigerian population, whereby 72.0% and 65.0% of respondents managing acute and chronic illnesses, respectively, had access to essential medicines. This can be attributed to the fact that essential workers like healthcare providers did not face restrictions to movement or running their healthcare facilities during the lockdown.",

We found that 84.0% of our respondents experienced deteriorating chronic health conditions in the light of difficulty in accessing essential medicines. A study demonstrated that comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory diseases could affect the outcome of COVID-19 infection. 17 Arguably, the fear of contracting COVID-19 and the poor outcomes in background comorbidity deterred our respondents from seeking their medicines. We could not, however, ascertain if there were any healthcare provider-related influences on the inability to obtain required medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Therefore, it may be worthwhile to consider strategies such as community-based responses to supplement healthcare assess where people cannot get to healthcare facilities during pandemics. This is supported by the significant increased resort to the readily available \"alternative therapy\" during the pandemic as shown in McNemar's test (Table 4 ).",

Our study showed that 73.9% of respondents living with chronic illness affirmed that their incomes were negatively affected by the pandemic, with a significant impact on income across the various categories of employment of the respondents.

Similar trends were observed in our study as 77.3% of the respondents reported an increase in medicine costs. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on drug security would be more significantly felt by developing countries as they rely heavily on imported drug products to meet their medication needs. 23 This highlights the need for policymakers in Nigeria to address challenges to large-scale and sustainable drug manufacturing, using the COVID-19 situation as a learning opportunity. Because of the stay-at-home order imposed on nonessential workers, 73.9% of the study participants with acute and chronic conditions, respectively, confirmed that their sources of income were affected. Interestingly, only 10.0% of the Nigerian population has health insurance coverage. 24 It could be argued that people who make out-of-pocket payments would most profoundly experience the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on income generation and therefore their purchasing power.",
