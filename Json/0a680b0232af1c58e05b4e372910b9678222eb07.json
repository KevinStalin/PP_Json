There have been several accounts of Big Deals cancellations by academic libraries in the scientific literature. This paper presents the finding of a literature review aimed at documenting the aftermath of Big Deal cancellation in University Libraries, particularly their impacts on interlibrary loan services. We find that many academic libraries have successfully cancelled their Big Deals, realizing budget savings while limiting negative effects on library users. In particular, existing literature reveals that cancellations have a surprisingly small effect on interlibrary loan requests. The reviewed studies further highlight the importance of access to proper usage data and inclusion of community members of the community (staff, faculty members, students, etc.) in the decision-making process.",

Using download statistics from recent years, they established an average price-per-use for each title. They cancelled both Big Deals and purchased around 200 individual titles, saving approximately $400,000 and losing 2800 journals including all social science journals. The library retained perpetual access to some titles, but only for older material. They authors have not reported any information on ILL. The authors also regret using only usage statistics to determine the final mix of titles for the library. They wish they would have had the time to involve the faculties and other librarians in the process. They received mixed feedback: librarians have been \"disheartened\" by the loss of so much content, while the teaching faculty has been offered the option to swap titles. Students did not express any opinions on the unsubscriptions.",

They did retain perpetual access to all unsubscribed titles. After one year, they observed a small increase in ILL requests. Only 27% of the unsubscribed Wiley titles had at least one request, and 9% had more than one for a total of 71 ILL requests. Wiley titles ILL demand represented 0.9% of its prior use. Among Elsevier titles, 38% had at least one ILL request, and 20% had more than one for a total of 46 requests. This represented 0.3% of its prior use. The community reaction to the cancellation was minimal. They received a small number of complaints; most being attributed to confusion or a lack of information.

The authors reported a total of 1,118 ILL requests for the cancelled Wiley titles over the five years. This same list of titles received 11,254 downloads in the year prior to the cancellation. So, the authors estimate that after five years, cancelled titles have generated about 10% as many ILL requests as compared to pre-cancellation annual downloads. This is in contrast to the numbers after one year, when the authors estimated that ILL requests were only 0.3% of the pre-cancellation usage count.",

In the next twelve to eighteen months after the cancellations, they observed a small increase in the number of ILL transactions, with requests for cancelled titles accounting for 1-4% of total transactions. Given these two facts, we can estimate that requests for cancelled titles directly increased ILL traffic by no more than 4%.

They decided to use a slightly different method: instead of cancelling, they used a pay-per-view system based on tokens. They compared the costs of this system against subscriptions and ILL costs pre and post cancellation of their Wiley subscriptions. Pay-per-view articles were paid with tokens that would make an article available for 24 hours. Token price varied from $12.25 to $32.25 depending on how many they ordered. They cancelled each journal with a cost-per-use of $30.00 per article, for a total of $147.999 annually or the equivalent of 12,081 tokens (at $12.25 per). In 2010, they would have saved $110,416 if they had used tokens instead of subscriptions. In 2012, their pay-per-view costs were $156,322.25 compared to the $1,265,866 they would have paid if they had subscribed to the 764 journals. The total number of access rose from 3,068 to 12,761 from 2010 to 2012. Their analyses showed no abuse of the pay-per-view service. Considering the copyright fees of ILL requests, the authors estimate that the pay-per-view token system also allowed them to save money in ILL fees.",

In 2018-2019, they saved $200,000, $441,450, and $800,000 from Springer, Wiley and Elsevier respectively. The expected increase in ILL requests has not materialized, making ILL much more cost efficient than the former subscription costs. They received a total of 180 requests for Springer titles but they only paid for one ($39.95), 310 requests for Wiley and paid for 27 articles ($853.90 total costs, with an average of $31.63), and 3,604 requests for Elsevier titles but only paid for 198 of them ($4,400.70 or an average of $22.23). To this date, they received very few complaints from students and faculties about the cancellation.",

They retained perpetual access to all of their titles in exchange for a fee of 0.06 euros per download for titles. Nine months after the cancellation, there was no increase in ILL or article deliveries. Deliveries have gone up after the subscription of large research institutions to the service, driving the average monthly fee from 26,000 euros to 40,000. After surveying researchers, 54% of them claimed that the cancellation had harmed their work, while 38% of them said that it had no impact. Nearly half of the respondents had a negative view of the cancellation, while 37% had not. When searching for articles, 81% of researchers faced an Elsevier paywall, 42% of researchers found at least one missing article online, and 42% gave up their search at least once. Ultimately, this cancellation led to a new Read and Publish agreement with Elsevier in 2019 for a slightly cheaper price than their previous subscription. They project savings of 1.7 million euros in 2022 in subscription and APC fees.",

However, these examples have all underlined the importance of having access to proper usage data and to include members of the community (staff, faculty members, students, etc.) in the decision process.
