Only one patient received 4 tests with a negative on the first swab, the second of which was positive, and the following two were negative. The probability that the second test would be positive given that the first test was negative was 4.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 7.6%). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of time on the probability of a positive second test. Given an initial negative result, the probability of a positive result on a second test increased with the length of time between the initial and subsequent test (odds ratio \u03ed 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.09; P \u03ed 0.03). Chart review indicated that 55% of the patients with positive second tests were HCP or had experienced additional exposures, prolonged symptoms, or symptoms that recurred after a resolution period. Thus, repeat testing after a negative result is more likely to be useful when there is strong clinical suspicion of COVID.",

A limitation to this study is that up to three different testing platforms with potentially different performance characteristics were used, prohibiting us from distinguishing if differences in test results were due to analytic variability. However, the differences in performance characteristics have been shown to be small for the platforms under consideration (3) . In this specific data set, the number of tests that could have been reduced by prohibiting subsequent testing was modest (n \u03ed 296 tests; 3.5% of all tests), only supports decreased testing within the first week of the negative result, and was shown to be diagnostic in a small percentage of cases. However, as testing demands continue to increase, testing supply and operational capacity will continue to be limited. Specific guidance for repeat testing will be critical to mitigate supply with clinical relevance.",
