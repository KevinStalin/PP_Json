Analysis of Chinese data revealed three times higher case fatality among those with COPD. Several potential therapies such as direct anti-virals and interferons, as well as (hydroxy)-chloroquine with a less obvious mechanism are under investigation, 1 although early study data suggest that effectiveness is limited. 2 For many years we have been advocating for a nonantibiotic approach to common respiratory infections in COPD, such as Haemophilus influenzae and rhinovirus, by utilising what we now know about the general microbial requirement for (blockable) airway epithelial adhesion before clinical infection can occur, for example using available platelet-activating factor-receptor (PAFr) blockers. 3 A similar promising therapeutic target with drugs already available could be blockade of host adhesion sites that SARS-CoV2 employs for epithelial adherence before invasion. 4 These could be used for prophylaxis or just deteriorating respiratory status.",

Thus, especially those COPD patients or smokers who do not respond to the available therapies could be treated with clinically safe anti-adhesion drugs such as ARB, or TMPRSS2 inhibitor or specific mono-/polyclonals. It should also be important to collect/analyse epidemiological data for individuals who currently are on ACE-I/ARB, and compare clinically significant infection rates and outcomes with those not taking such a drug. Any perceivable differences in the prevalence, severity, mortality or SARS-2 viral titres would help ascertain the role of ACE-2 in COVID-19, which may prove helpful for any further waves of this infection, or the next virulent COVID to emerge.",
