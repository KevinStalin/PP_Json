SLTs can play a key role in the prevention of hospital admissions and readmissions for vulnerable groups in the community. Further, SLTs assist in expediting inpatient discharge. Such contributions support the government's plan to shield the high risk and support wider risk groups (RCSLT 2020a). The RCSLT has also highlighted the key skills and expertise which SLTs have to meet some of the clinical presentation needs of patients with COVID-19 (RCSLT 2020a). SLTs in many centres are being redeployed, for example, to ICUs in 'buddy' roles to support nursing and medical staff managing acutely ill COVID-19 patients. In addition to increased capacity, buddies are being used to support pressures on service provision due to increased COVID and non-COVID-related staff sickness. The ability to undertake new roles should be underpinned by access to appropriate training to prepare individuals (RCSLT 2020a), and potentially the opportunity to be upskilled to allow for continued professional development.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Redeployment and meeting existing and emerging needs"}, {"text": "It is also emerging that those recovering from COVID-19 are requiring the specialist skills of SLTs post-COVID-19 infection.

When patients are extubated and moving to intermediate-level care, the SLT has an essential role in the supporting communication, swallowing and airway management (RCSLT 2020a). For patients who are receiving end-of-life care, SLTs can play a key role in advocacy and supporting quality-of-life-focused decisions with regards to eating and drinking.
