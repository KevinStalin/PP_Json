Four water-immiscible ionic liquids (butyltriethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, octyltriethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, dodecyltriethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) and their water miscible precursors (bromides) were synthesized in a microwave reactor and by conventional heating. The best conditions for microwave-assisted synthesis concerning the yield and the purity of the product are proposed. The heating in the microwave reactor significantly shortened the reaction time. Biocide and ecotoxic effects of synthesized ionic liquids and their precursors were investigated. All tested compounds had at least a little effect on the growth or living of microorganisms (bacteria or mold). The precursor dodecyltriethylammonium bromide was found to be the strongest biocide, but posed a risk to the aquatic environment due to its relatively high EC 50 value in the test with Vibrio fischeri. We assumed that apart from the alkyl chain length, the solubility in water, duration of action, or type of anion can influence the final biocide and ecotoxic effect.

Methods can be classified according to whether the solvent is present or not. The classical two-step solvent-free path involves quaternization and metathesis [2] . Quaternization is a nucleophilic substitution of S N 2 and relatively long reaction times (of the order of several days) are required to achieve high yields. The strength of the nucleophilic agent influences the rate of this reaction. As an advanced technology, microwave irradiation has been employed. The reduction of the reaction time in the preparation of N-alkylimidazolium salts in the microwave field has been described by Varma and Namboodiri [4], who achieved a 4 to 5-fold reduction in the time for the preparation of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and bromide. The second step-metathesis (ionic exchange)-is based on the different solubility of the reactants and products in the aqueous medium. The reaction runs at elevated temperature and requires a short reaction time [4] .",

Deetlefs and Seddon, Khadilkar and Rebeiro [5, 6] described the preparation of 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide. Bhatt et al. [7] performed a microwave synthesis of dicationic ammonium salts. Dong et al. [2] briefly described the microwave-assisted synthesis of [N2224] [Br] and [N2224] [NTf2]. Physico-chemical properties of RTILs can be tailored by modifying their structure. Ionic liquids composed of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion (NTf2) and different cations are expected to be useful for many practical applications in a wide range of areas, including electrochemistry, synthesis, and separation processes [8]. RTILs were often used in environmentally friendly applications, e.g., for aquatic pollutant extraction. AlSaleem et al. [9] studied the possibilities of extraction and oxidative destruction of halogenated carbohydrates by ionic liquids with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide anion. Cacho et al. [10] tested the ability of extraction of organophosphate pesticides by [C4MIM][NTf2] from water with a yield greater than 97%. Yao et al. [11] extracted several drugs including paracetamol and ibuprofen from water with a yield greater than 91%. Cull et al. [12] achieved similar efficiency when erythromycin was extracted to [C4MIM][PF 6 ] and butylacetate, whereas Manic et al. [13] extracted erythromycin to [C4C1pyrr][NTf2] with a yield of over 80%. The emulsion liquid membrane prepared from [C4MIM][NTf2] was tested for phenol, 2-chlorophenol, and 4-nitrophenol extraction from water [14]. Goyal et al.

Studies showing toxicity to bacteria [21, 22] and fungi [23] , and to the influence of enzymatic activity [24] [25] [26] have been published. Quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) are used as effective antiseptic agents under designation as cationic agents or cationic detergents [27] . In clinical practice, they are used for pre-operative disinfection of intact skin, application to mucous membranes, and disinfection of non-critical surfaces. The fact that QAS are membrane-active agents has been known for many years. Salton [28] proposed the following scheme of action of cationic agents on living microorganisms: (i) adsorption of the agent to the cell wall and its penetration into the cell wall; (ii) reaction with the cytoplasmic membrane (lipid or protein) followed by membrane disorganization; (iii) leakage of low molecular weight intracellular matter; (iv) protein and nucleic acid degradation; (v) wall decomposition by autolytic enzymes. The effect is facilitated by the interaction of the positive charge on the quaternary ammonium group with the polar groups contained in the phospholipid heads [29] . QAS is also believed to damage the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, thereby promoting their uptake. Moreover, QASs are sporostatic, they inhibit the growth of spores (the development of a vegetative cell from germination of spores) but not the actual germination processes (development from dormancy to a metabolically active state), Publisher's Note: MDPI stays neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.",

Such low melting points are mainly due to their composition. The combination of a larger asymmetric organic cation with smaller inorganic counterparts reduces the energy in the crystal lattice and hence the melting point of the resulting ionic liquid. Room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are of particular interest for practical applications. Thanks to this property, they can replace common solvents; they can dissolve organic, inorganic, organometallic, and polymeric substances. Uses of ionic liquids are usually determined from the melting point up to their decomposition temperature. The main advantage of ionic liquids includes the very low vapour pressure caused by their ionic character. Due to this, they are considered as green substitutes for volatile organic industrial solvents. This feature reduces the risk of exposure and solvent loss due to evaporation, thereby reducing air pollution [1] .",

            "text": "Ionic liquids can be used as disinfectants against viruses. The effectiveness of the virus disinfectant is largely influenced by the type and structure of the virus. Non-lipid viruses generally need to be killed using broad-spectrum disinfectants. Sensitivity to lipophilic-type biocidal agents, e.g., 2-phenylphenol (cationic ionic liquid), chlorhexidine, and isopropanol, can be expected for viruses with a lipid envelope of hydrophobic nature [27] . Coronaviruses are enveloped (+)ssRNA viruses, with a lipid envelope. Rabenau et al. [31] tested the effectiveness of eight disinfectants against coronavirus SARS-CoV. Several selected formulations included two agents based on a 0.5% cationic ammonium salt mixture. Both benzalkonium chloride mixed with dodecylamine, and benzalkonium chloride mixed with glutaraldehyde and didecyldimethylammonium chloride, showed inactivation of SARS-CoV after 30 min. In their review, Kampf et al. [32] gathered information from studies on coronavirus's resistance against biocidal agents. Wood and Payne [33] showed very good antiviral effects of benzalkonium chloride against human coronavirus ATCC VR-759. Similar conclusions were reached by Saknimit et al. [34] testing benzalkonium chloride against canine coronavirus strain I-71. Pratelli [35] confirmed the efficacy of benzalkonium chloride against canine coronavirus in strain S378 and found good antiviral effects of didecyldimethylammonium chloride in the same strain.",

With respect to physico-chemical properties of synthesized ionic liquids, we hypothesized the possible application of ILs as biocides, e.g., additives to paints and coatings (dispersants with antibacterial and antifungal properties), components in antibacterial cleaners, or disinfection agents in wastewater treatment.

            "text": "The use of microwave heating in the synthesis of selected ILs resulted in a noticeable reduction in reaction times while achieving acceptable yields (Table 1) in accordance with results published previously [4] . Purity information for the synthesis of selected ILs in a microwave reactor is not available in the literature in sufficient quantity, so the results cannot be compared with other studies. Synthesis in the classical way is very well studied and there are many scientific articles on this topic. Physico-chemical parameters of synthesized ILs, including NMR spectra, can be found in the literature [46] [47] [48] [49] . The yield of ammonium ionic liquids did not exceed 31% when conventional heating was applied up to 48 h, whereas in the microwave reactor, the yields between 58 and 86% were achieved in less than 12 h. The smallest effect of using microwaves was seen in the synthesis of [C4MIM][Br], which was strongly exothermic and required a very slight application of heating. The largest reduction in reaction time was achieved with [N222,12] [Br], where at the same time the yield almost doubled. The MW synthesis proceeded without the addition of a solvent. The addition of a solvent to the reaction mixture helps to increase the effect of microwave radiation and could significantly reduce the reaction time, but as a result may contribute to new problems in the purification of the final synthesis product. The low boiling point of butyl bromide causes a temperature limitation of the reactions and a reduction in yields. This disadvantage can be eliminated by using a high-pressure reactor. A water content of 0.04-3.27 wt.% is considered the largest contaminant in synthesized ionic liquids. The residual water content of ILs is primarily related to the nature of the anion. The purification system was effective to achieve the highest purity of ionic liquids. All synthesized products were verified by infrared spectroscopy and elemental analysis. All quaternisation products are odourless white crystalline substances. Ion exchange products are very viscous colourless substances; [N2228] [NTf2] is mostly yellowish.",

            "text": "Inhibition of growth after contact with ILs in the aquatic environment was tested for three different species of microorganisms (Figure 1) 12] [Br] and standard benzalkonium chloride. More than 60% inhibition of growth of WWTP bacteria were observed for all bromides and benzalkonium chloride. It can be summarized that bromides influenced microorganism growth more than triflimides (NTf2) and that triflimides were better fungicides than bactericides. The extending alkyl chain led to a higher inhibitory effect in bromides, but a lower inhibitory effect in triflimides. This fact is surprising and can be attributed to different solubility of ILs and their precursors in water. While bromides are very soluble in water (tens of wt. percent), the solubility of triflimides is very low (units of wt. percent). ILs containing shorter alkyl chains are more soluble than ILs with longer alkyl chains. Therefore, due to the high solubility of bromides, their biocide effect could be more affected by the length of the alkyl chain, whereas the biocide effect of triflimides could be closely related to water solubility. The dependence of inhibitory effect during the formation of biofilms on the length of the alkyl chain was previously shown for imidazolium ILs. Compounds (chlorides) with longer side chain lengths showed potent activity even at lower concentrations as compared to ILs with shorter chain lengths [50] . The ecotoxic effect of imidazolium ionic liquids with Cl \u2212 , PF 6 \u2212 and BF 4 \u2212 anions with longer chain lengths was also increased [51] . Longer alkyl chains were probably incorporated into the polar headgroups of the phospholipid bilayer, which led to membrane damage of microorganisms [52] . Contrary to these findings, biodegradation of phosphonium ionic liquids containing bromide was low and not dependent on alkyl chain length, and the presence of triflimide anion instead of bromide further inhibited the biodegradation [53] . In this case, DMSO (10 wt.%) was used to improve the water solubility of studied compounds, therefore results obtained in this experiment may be slightly different from the previous experiment ( Figure 2) . Nevertheless, the effect of DMSO itself was tested independently, and no inhibition of growth of B. subtilis was found up to 15 wt.% solution of DMSO in water. [55] , which is in agreement with our results. According to Couling et al. [56] , many of the imidazolium compounds were more toxic to Vibrio fischeri than common solvents such as acetonitrile, acetone, and methanol. On the contrary, low alkyl chain length quaternary ammonium ILs and those ILs containing choline as the cation were relatively nontoxic to Vibrio fischeri in their study. We found a similar trend, i.e., relatively low acute toxicity for Couling et al. [56] assessed the factors responsible for ionic liquid toxicity to aquatic organisms via quantitative structure-property relationship modelling. Their results showed increasing alkyl chain length increases the IL toxicity for both Vibrio fischeri and Daphnia magna, and that cation properties have a larger effect on toxicity than anion properties. Nevertheless, bromides in our study usually showed a different ecotoxic effect on Vibrio fisheri than triflimides, which points to the non-negligible influence of the anion on acute toxicity. The inhibition of the growth of microorganisms in biocide tests was also species-dependent, with a balanced and strong inhibitory effect of [N222,12] [Br] in all experiments. Similarly to our results, Sandbacka et al. [57] found relatively high acute toxicity (among 12 surfactants) of [N222,12] [Br] to Daphnia magna. The exchange of [Br] to [NTf2] reduced the biocide effect, but not the acute ecotoxic effect. This could be influenced by the duration of action; in biocide tests, the contact time of compounds with microorganisms was 1 h in solution and another 48 h during testing, whereas acute toxicity was examined within 15 and 30 min. Therefore, we assume that the length of the alkyl chain of the cation is not the only feature that causes the inhibitory effect on microorganisms in the aquatic environment; the solubility in water, duration of action, type of anion, and possible other compound characteristics can influence the final biocide and ecotoxic effect.",

However, the reaction time for classical synthesis is on the order of tens of hours to days. Preparation of ionic liquids in a microwave reactor should contribute to reduction in reaction time of the synthesis, and lead to a higher purity of the product and a higher yield. Several new findings were identified in the presented work. (i) The microwave field has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the synthesis of both imidazole and ammonium ionic liquids. We defined the conditions for microwave-assisted synthesis that led to a sufficient yield and purity of products. (ii) All tested compounds had at least a little effect on the growth or living of microorganisms (bacteria and mold). We showed that results of biocide tests depended on tested species and were influenced not only by the length of the alkyl chain of IL, but also on its solubility in water and type of anion. In general, bromides influenced microorganism growth more than triflimides (NTf2), and triflimides were better fungicides than bactericides. Dodecyltriethylammonium bromide showed strong biocide and ecotoxic effects in all tests. (iii) The antibacterial and antifungal effects of studied ILs together with an ecotoxicity that was comparable or lower than the widely used benzalkonium chloride predestine these compounds for testing in applications in the field of paints and coatings, antibacterial cleaners or, in the case of low water-soluble ILs, as disinfection agents for wastewater treatment.

Acute toxicity in the aquatic environment was studied and EC 50 values were obtained for Vibrio fischeri (Table 2). The samples of ionic liquids containing bromides showed different toxicological index EC 50 values determined by the acute toxicity test on the luminescent bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The highest toxic effect was detected for [N222,12][Br] and a slightly smaller toxic effect for [N2224][Br]. This value is comparable to the EC 50 for the reference substance, potassium dichromate (30 min EC 50 = 2.8 mg.L \u22121 ). [C4MIM][Br] showed a significantly lower toxic effect, while [N2228][Br] exhibited a negligible toxic effect. In the case of ionic liquids containing the NTf2 group, the obtained EC 50 values were quite similar for [N2228][NTf2] and [N222,12][NTf2], and in general, both chemicals can be considered as toxic for the environment using Vibrio fischeri as a bioindicator. Ecotoxicity of [N222,12][NTf2] was comparable to ecotoxicity of benzalkonium chloride (EC 50 0.5 mg.L \u22121 [54]). The highest EC 50 value was 30 min EC 50 120.93 mg.L \u22121 for [N2224][NTf2].
