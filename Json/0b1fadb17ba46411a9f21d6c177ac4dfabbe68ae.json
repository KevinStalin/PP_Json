Surveys showed 80 percent of households experience water scarcity. Respondents reported not having enough water to flush toilets, shower, wash hands, or do laundry. Annual well maintenance costs averaged $1405; additional costs included dealing with water shortage and buying additional items to cope.

Naman and Gibson 16 described the challenge in organizing communities and unifying to raise awareness to a community problem. Individual differences in levels of need for municipal services can create a fractured front to municipal governments.

When talking about cost, participants often had concerns with payment, either with their neighbors' abilities to pay or their own. Residents were also impacted financially by their lack of water quantity through the many routes taken to compensate for their well problems. In a study on the factors affecting access to municipal and sewer services in North Carolina, community members, utility providers, and officials referred to the costs of extending these services. 16 Although opinions differed on costs versus benefits, we can see how cost remains a constant factor for residents attempting annexation, and that it may be a shared concern to town officials, limiting their assistance to communities.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 576, "end": 578, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Lacking sufficient water to meet daily hygiene needs produces health risks, increasing the risk that Irongate residents will contract and transmit infectious diseases.

COVID-19 has both health and financial implications as the public attempts to keep themselves healthy on strained budgets due to unemployment and lack of services. Without adequate water supply, Irongate residents are placed at a further disadvantage, with underlying health risks in a community averaging a lower income than its municipality and a higher median age of residents.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although twenty-one of twenty-four households completed the survey, the interview portion was optional, meaning the data were collected from those more willing to participate in the surveys.

In addition, the low sample size indicates that any inferences of the analysis of the qualitative interview data, or those more concerned about the issue, may not be adequate in identifying common beliefs in this population. However, the eight interviews represented one-third of the households in the community, and the number of interviews is counterbalanced by the nearly full participation in the short-form surveys.

The stories community members reported during neighborhood meetings with town officials about their experiences with water shortages, combined with data on water contamination risks supplied by the University of North Carolina and support by civil rights attorneys, appear to have helped build a case for annexation. Apex was able to obtain a Community Development Block Grant to support most of the cost of the water supply extension project. Nonetheless, as of the writing of this article, individual households still will be required to pay nearly $1800 to connect to the water system.

For example, a 2014 study 6 in Wake County found that odds of exclusion from municipal well water service increases with an increase in the proportion of African-American residents within a census block. Leker and Gibson 5 found that within 8758 peri-urban blocks selected in seventy-five North Carolina counties, 67 percent of the population were unserved by sewer pipes, 33 percent by water pipes, and 28 percent lacked both sewer and water service. Environmental injustice through municipal underbounding affects many communities across the South, with Lichter et al. 12 providing evidence to show that municipal underbounding and racial exclusion have patterns in many small, southern towns. These communities are numerous and may face similar problems with water and sewer.
