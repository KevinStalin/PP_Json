Initially, dermatologists were faced with a parallel \"epidemic\" of dermatitis caused by continuous washing and the use of personal protective equipment. At the same time, we started to observe two things: first, the presence of skin disorders in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, with very different degrees of severity; and second, the fact that these conditions only sometimes appeared to be associated with known causes, such as herpes zoster or toxicoderma. Even more intriguing, we started to see skin lesions in patients with only very mild symptoms of COVID-19 or no other symptoms at all. We were struck by the repeated appearance of certain symptoms and their particular characteristics. The most common cutaneous manifestations observed were urticarial lesions, vesicular and maculopapular rashes (similar to those of other viral infections), livedo reticularis, pityriasis rosea, violaceous erythema, and chilblain-like lesions on the hands and feet. The pseudochilblains are were atypical because they were occurring during a period when temperatures were not low and in people with no history of erythema pernio.",

The data would be collected over a 2-week period at the peak of the pandemic. Hoping to find 4 or 5 different patterns, we calculated that the necessary sample would be 60 cases.
