[5] [6] [7] An association between Zika virus and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome was first described in French Polynesia in 2013, 8 and subsequently described elsewhere. 9,10 Large Zika outbreaks affected Brazil from 2015 onwards, when other forms of acute neurological and congenital Zika disease were first reported. 11, 12 The role of Zika virus in causing CNS disease after the neonatal period is still not well defined, with the literature comprising mostly case reports and small case series. 5, [12] [13] [14] Chikungunya virus infection has been linked to both CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) disease, though there have been few large studies 6 describing its importance.",

Because Zika and dengue are both flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae), serological cross-reactivity between them can complicate antibody-based diagnostics; 15 this is not an issue with chikungunya virus because it belongs to a different genus and family (Alphavirus, family Togaviridae). After infection with an arbovirus, lifelong immunity typically develops. For dengue, sequential infection by different serotypes can cause more severe disease. 16 Although laboratory studies suggest that Zika virus entry into cells can be enhanced by dengue antibodies, 17, 18 epidemiological data indicate that previous exposure to dengue might protect against symptomatic Zika infec tion. 19 Infection with more than one pathogen is thought to contribute to more severe disease in some brain infections. 20, 21 The effect of previous dengue or chikun gunya infection on the risk of developing neurologi cal Zika disease is not known, although arbovirus co-infection has been reported in some patients with neuro logical disease. 13, 22 To better understand the spectrum of infectious and post-infectious immune-mediated neurological disease caused by arboviruses, and the effect of dual infection, we studied adults with suspected arboviral neurological disease in Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil, during the 2015-16 Zika and chikungunya outbreaks. We were especially interested in whether the pattern of disease differed according to the infecting arbovirus, and whether patients with more than one virus infection had a different disease spectrum or severity.",

For both chikungunya and Zika, most reports are for a single virus infection, although evidence exists that arboviruses increasingly co-circulate. More detailed information is needed on the neurological features of patients infected with different arboviruses and on the effect of dual infection.",

This approach differentiates our study from previous ones, which usually describe specific disease syndromes linked to Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus alone. Our study shows a high frequency of dual chikungunya and Zika virus infections in patients with neurological disease, underscoring the need for clinicians to investigate for evidence of both pathogens. Although both chikungunya and Zika viruses caused a large range of CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS) manifestations, chikungunya was more often associated with CNS disease, especially myelitis, whereas Zika was more often linked to PNS disease, especially Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.",

Epidemiological studies indicate that Zika and chikungunya seroprevelance is not so high as to preclude such outbreaks in the future. Our study will help clinicans to recognise and appropriately investigate patients with arbovirus infections, which will allow them to provide accurate diagnosis and plan management accordingly. Policy makers should consider the burden of arbovirus-associated neurological complications when developing public health programmes. Future studies should investigate how often arbovirus-associated neurological disease occurs in children, an understudied population, and further characterise the contribution of arbovirus infections to stroke.",

We have shown that, although the viruses cause a similar broad range of CNS and PNS manifestations, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is predominant in patients with Zika infections, whereas CNS disease is more common in patients with chikun gunya infections. The past two decades have seen a remarkable spread in the distribution of these emerging arboviruses. Chikungunya virus, first identified in Tanzania in 1953, caused outbreaks in Africa and southeast Asia in the 1960s and 1970s. From 2004 onwards, chikungunya virus caused large epidemics, spreading to the Pacific Islands in 2011, and the Americas in 2013. 6 Zika virus has spread even more rapidly. Isolated initially in Uganda in 1947, the virus was considered a benign cause of occasional febrile illness. 33 However, Zika virus caused large outbreaks in Micronesia in 2007, French Polynesia in 2014 (where the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome link was first recognised), and Brazil in 2015, where its role in causing microcephaly was established. 8, 11, 34 As arboviruses spread, the need to understand their severe manifestations and the effect of dual infection becomes even more crucial, particularly because the areas affected by different viruses overlap increasingly. 4, 13, 22 We found that, while both Zika and chikungunya viruses can cause Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, patients with Zika infection presented more rapidly after their prodromal illness than those with chikungunya infection (median 7 vs 26 days). The rapid onset of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome after Zika infection has been suggested as a useful distinguishing feature, 9,10 reflecting para-infectious rather than post-infectious mechanisms, 35 but whether this time interval is significantly shorter than that for other pathogens is unclear. 36 High incidence of facial involvement has also been suggested as a marker of Zika-associated Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, 5 but we found that facial involvement was equally common (just higher than 50%) in patients with chikungunya-associated Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.",

Considerable attention has been given to acute flaccid myelitis caused by enteroviruses, particularly enterovirus D68; 37 our study is a pertinent reminder that arboviruses should also be considered in such cases in endemic areas or in returning travellers.

T2-weighted MRI (D) and DWI MRI (E) of a 78-year-old man positive for chikungunya virus with a stroke. The patient, with a history of hypertension, developed left-sided hemiparesis and dysarthria 7 days after onset of systemic symptoms of rash, myalgia, arthralgia, and joint oedema. Serum was positive for chikungunya virus IgM antibodies. MRI shows features of acute ischaemia, including an area of restricted diffusion involving the left PCA territory (medial temporal lobe and the left occipital lobe acute medially, including the lingual gyrus). (F) Follow-up CT at 6 weeks in the same patient, showing an established left PCA territory infarct with involution. CT of the head (G), T2-weighted MRI (H), and DWI MRI of the brain (I) of a patient positive for Zika and chikungunya virus with a stroke. The patient, a 64-year-old woman with hypertension, developed a left-sided hemiparesis 12 weeks after onset of systemic viral symptoms. Serum was positive for Zika virus on PCR and IgM testing, and chikungunya virus on IgM testing. She presented at hospital again 3 months after neurological symptom onset and imaging was done. (G) CT showing an area of gyral hyperdensity with surrounding low density change in the left frontal lobe and a mass effect. (H, I) MRI imaging showing an area of signal abnormality in the left frontal lobe (middle frontal gyrus) with restricted diffusion and areas of susceptibility. These features are suggestive of ischaemia with areas of haemorrhage within it, indicative of a subsequent, more recent event after the initial presentation 3 months before.

Zika and chikungunya dual infection was found in 46 (31%) of 148 patients: 13 (9%) had co-infection, with both viruses detected by PCR (six [4%] in serum and five [3%] in CSF; two [1%] patients were Zika positive in CSF and chikungunya positive in serum); 26 (18%) were Zika positive with PCR and chikungunya IgM positive (eight [5%] were Zika PCR positive in CSF, and 18 [12%] in serum); one (<1%) was chikungunya PCR positive (in CSF) and Zika IgM positive (CSF and serum); six (4%) were positive for Zika and chikungunya IgM antibodies in serum alone. Three (2%) of these patients with dual infection had evidence of both Zika and dengue IgM and a comparable neutralising antibody titre on PRNT, but were defined as Zika because of epidemiological linkage. Four (3%) patients had chikungunya and dengue dual infection (on the basis of IgM in serum). Overall, 179 (89%) of 201 patients had anti-dengue IgG antibodies, indicating previous exposure; this did not predispose to a specific neurological syndrome, nor did it affect clinical outcome. For the 148 patients positive on arbovirus testing with either mono-infection or dual infection, the most frequent systemic arbovirus symptoms overall were rash (in 123 [83%] patients), fever (114 [77%]), arthralgia (112 [76%]), and myalgia (94 [64%]; table 1). Fever, arthralgia, and joint oedema were more common in patients with a positive arbovirus test than in those with a negative test (table 1). Patients with chikungunya mono-infection were signi ficantly more likely than those with Zika monoinfection to have fever (47 [85%] of 55 patients with chikungunya infection vs 21 [51%] of 41 with Zika infection; p=0\u00b70003), joint oedema (36 [65%] vs 16 [39%]; p=0\u00b7010), or arthralgia (47 [85%] vs 25 [61%]; p=0\u00b70061) and were less likely to report cough (three [5%] vs nine [22%]; p=0\u00b7016). However, rash and conjunc tivitis, often suggested as symptoms that can help distinguish Zika from chikungunya infection, did not differ significantly between these groups. Compared with patients with mono-infection, those with dual infec tion more frequently reported fever (68 [71%] of 96 patients with mono-infection vs 42 [91%] of 46 with dual infection; p=0\u00b70063) and vomiting (24 [25%] vs 19 [41%]; p=0\u00b7048). These results remained significant when we excluded the five patients with positive flavivirus tests who were classified as having Zika infection on epidemi ological grounds. The patients who tested positive for Zika, chikungunya, or dengue virus-either with mono-infection or dual infection-presented with various neurological manifestations (table 3). The disease syndromes were grouped into five disease categories: CNS, PNS, mixed CNS and PNS, cranial neuropathy, and other neurological disease (table 4). Of the 41 patients with Zika mono-infection, six (15%) had CNS disease, 26 (63%) had PNS disease (of whom 25 [61%] had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), two (5%) had mixed CNS and PNS disease, three (7%) had cranial neuro pathies, and four (10%) had other neurological disease. Of 55 patients with chikun gunya mono-infection, 26 (47%) had CNS disease, nine (16%) had PNS disease (of whom seven [13%] had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome), three (5%) had mixed CNS and PNS disease, nine (16%) had cranial neuropathies (including two [4%] with abducens nerve paresis), and eight (15%) had other neurological disease. One (50%) patient with dengue had myelitis and the other (50%) had Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In 46 patients with dual infection with Zika and chikungunya, 13 (28%) had CNS disease, 15 (33%) had PNS disease, two (4%) had mixed CNS and PNS disease, six (13%) had cranial neuropathies, and ten (22%) had other neurological disease. We observed an overall difference in neurological manifesta tions depending on the infecting arbovirus. When comparing the clinical features of patients with Zika mono-infection with those of patients with chikungunya mono-infection, patients diagnosed with Zika infection presented more often with facial weakness, quadriparesis, or hyporeflexia on examination (table 3) and were more often diagnosed with PNS disease (26 [63%] of 41 patients with Zika infection vs nine [16%] of 55 with chikungunya infection, p<0\u00b70001; odds ratio [OR] 0\u00b711, 95% CI 0\u00b704-0\u00b729), mainly Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (table 4). Patients with chikungunya mono-infection presented more frequently with confusion, hyperreflexia, or sensory level on examination (table 3) and were more commonly diagnosed with CNS disease (26 [47%] with chikungunya infection vs six [15%] with Zika infection, p=0\u00b70008; OR 5\u00b723, 95% CI 1\u00b790-14\u00b743; table 4). These results were not affected by adjustment for demographic factors or comor bidities, and almost all clinical differences persisted when we excluded patients who presented with neurological disease more than 3 months after arbovirus infection (appendix 3, pp 10, 12). Patients with dual Zika and chikungunya infection presented more often with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack than those with either infec tion alone (eight [17%] of 46 with dual infection vs five [6%] of 96 with mono-infection, p=0\u00b7047; OR 3\u00b783, 95% CI 1\u00b718-12\u00b747). The signifi cance of this result was lost when adjusting for age and comorbidities (appendix 3, p 11). We did not find a differ ence in the frequency of neurological syndromes between patients with a positive arbovirus test and those with a negative test(table 4).We assessed in more detail the neurological syndromes seen most frequently in the patients with a positive arbovirus test in our study, namely encephalitis(16 [11%]   patients); myelitis(22 [15%]); ADEM (eight [5%]); and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (47 [32%]). All 16 patients with arboviral encephalitis presented with fever, rash, or both, followed by neurological disease; the median interval was 5 days (IQR 2-5) for patients with Zika mono-infection compared with 9 days (6-47) for those with chikungunya infection (p=0\u00b718). Most patients (14 [88%] of 16) had altered behaviour or reduced consciousness-only patients with cerebellitis or rhombencephalitis did notand seven (44%) had seizures; whether patients had seizures or not did not differ with viral diagnosis. Of the 16 patients with arboviral encephalitis, one (6%) with Zika infection also had meningism; of those with chikungunya infection, three (19%) had limb weakness, two (13%) had cerebellar signs, and one (6%) had ophthalmoplegia plus bulbar weakness; two (13%) patients with Zika and chikungunya dual infection had weakness in all four limbs Mono-infection was defined as laboratory test evidence of infection with a single virus; dual infection was defined as evidence of infection with more than one virus on the basis of a positive PCR or IgM test-infection might be concurrent or sequential; co-infection was defined as contemporaneous detection of RNA of more than one virus on PCR testing.
