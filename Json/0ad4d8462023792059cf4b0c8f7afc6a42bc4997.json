The proposed strategy will probably elucidate the true role of COVID-19-associated invasive fungal infections, especially COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). We have not found the same incidence of CAPA, probably due to the absence of an active search. However, we detected an increase in the number of fungemias in critically ill COVID-19 patients. We report 20 cases of fungemia in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 4 institutions in the northern region of Colombia from June to September 2020. We reviewed medical records and evaluated microbiological, demographic and clinical variables. Mortality was evaluated at 30 days after isolation of the yeast. Pathogen identification was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-fight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany). SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by RT PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The epidemiological and demographic characteristics, underlying conditions, treatments and outcomes of the 20 patients are shown in table 1.All patients received \u03b2-lactam antibiotics at the time of admission, and 5 patients received prophylactic antifungal therapy before the development of fungemia (3 with fluconazole and 2 with caspofungin). Nineteen of the 20 patients received steroids as part of the COVID-19 treatment The mean number of days from admission to the time of diagnosis of fungemia was 17.7 (range 6-35 days). The mean number of days from blood culture to antifungal treatment initiation was 3.9. Fifteen patients received antifungal treatment, Twelve (60%) patients died, and the mean number of days from the diagnosis of fungemia to the time of death was 6.1 (range 0-24 days). Six patients had fungemia caused by C. auris, four by C. albicans, 4 by C. tropicalis, 3 by C. parapsilosis, 1 by C. orthopsilosis, 1 by C. glabrata and 1 by Trichosporum asahii",

Currently, the use of steroids is part of the standard of care in managing patients with COVID-19 and hypoxemia. Although bacterial coinfection is low, the use of antimicrobials is common; therefore, the antimicrobial stewardship program must be strengthened for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection as part of preventive strategies for the development of fungemia (2) (3) In this case series, the time to develop fungemia was more significant than that reported by White et al. (17.7 days vs. 9 days), as was the mortality of this group of patients (60% vs. 47.1%).",

In places where C. auris is endemic, despite the strict control measures in place in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infection, coinfections by this microorganism continue to occur. Given the multiresistant characteristics of C. auris and the difficulties of eradicating it, we must not let our guard down in the era of COVID-19 in regard to both infection control policies and antimicrobial stewardship, including antifungals.",
