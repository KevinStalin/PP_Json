However, the vaccination coverage rate remains low in the MENA region. [9] [10] [11] All countries in the MENA region have reported COVID-19 cases starting from early February 2020. By 18 October 2020, countries in the MENA region reported 2 764 180 confirmed cases and 70 258 deaths. 12 However, these numbers are likely to be underestimated due to testing policies, which currently stands at 5723 tests per 100 000 population, early introduction of control and lockdown measures, and young demographic population. The attack rate is 378 per 100 000 population, and the case fatality rate is estimated at 2.5%. 12 The Global Health Security Index of vulnerability to biological threats shows significant differences in the level of preparedness across the region. 13 Weak health systems are exacerbated by low levels of public expenditures on health and high out-of-pocket spending, as well as a weak ability to grow overall health spending in the face of crises. Pandemic control measures have also impacted countries economically and socially and disrupted access to health care for other diseases and essential services, including vaccination.",

First, the effects of influenza, such as respiratory failure, decreased functional capacity, and concomitant cardiovascular complications will increase the risk of severe COVID-19 in an already high-risk population. 14 COVID-19 pandemic hits hard frail, elderly patients with chronic diseases and obese people who face the major threat of severe disease due to both seasonal influenza and COVID-19. 15, 16 Additionally, children under five years of age are at high risk of severe influenza infection, and considering the MENA region contains the largest population of vulnerable children, the impacts of seasonal influenza would be expected to multiply in the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic. 17 Secondly, the collision is anticipated to devastate the already overwhelmed healthcare system and burned out healthcare staff. Hospital beds, which are to be used by patients with viral respiratory infections in the fall and winter are already occupied with COVID-19 patients. In addition, there will be problems in differentiating influenza from COVID-19 disease as symptoms largely overlap, and testing will be needed to confirm the pathogen. Patients with other respiratory viral infections who otherwise would not seek medical service will increase the burden of patients waiting to be tested for SARS-CoV-2. The diagnosis of influenza will be critical as there are effective therapies against influenza virus that might help reduce the burden of influenza, sparing the limited resources for the care of COVID-19 cases. It should also be kept in mind that co-infected cases of influenza and COVID-19 have been reported, confounding testing results, delaying treatment, and leading to severe conditions. 18 The above-mentioned consequences should certainly be interpreted in the realities and social and economic vulnerabilities of the MENA region. The pandemic's collision with seasonal influenza will contribute to increased healthcare disparities, gender inequalities, poverty, unemployment, and conflicts in the region and lead to devastating and long-lasting consequences. 19 ",
