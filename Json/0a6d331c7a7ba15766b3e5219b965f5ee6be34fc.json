            "text": "Purpose In neuromuscular disorders (NMD), inspiratory muscle weakness may cause sleep-related hypoventilation requiring non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Alternatively, nasal high flow therapy (NHF) may ameliorate mild nocturnal hypercapnia (NH) through washout of anatomical dead space and generation of positive airway pressure. Ventilatory support by NIV or NHF might have favourable short-term effects on sympathovagal balance (SVB). This study comparatively investigated the effects of NHF and NIV on sleep-related breathing and SVB in NMD patients with evolving NH. Methods Transcutaneous CO 2 (p tc CO 2 ), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), sleep outcomes and SVB (spectral analysis of heart rate, diastolic blood pressure variability) along with haemodynamic measures (cardiac index, total peripheral resistance index) were evaluated overnight in 17 patients. Polysomnographies (PSG) were randomly split into equal parts with no treatment, NIV and NHF at different flow rates (20 l/min vs. 50 l/min). In-depth analysis of SVB and haemodynamics was performed on 10min segments of stable N2 sleep taken from each intervention. Results Compared with no treatment, NHF20 and NHF50 did not significantly change p tc CO 2 , SpO 2 or the apnea hypopnea index (AHI). NHF50 was poorly tolerated. In contrast, NIV significantly improved both gas exchange and AHI without adversely affecting sleep. During daytime, NHF20 and NHF50 had neutral effects on ventilation and oxygenation whereas NIV improved p tc CO 2 and SpO 2 . Effects of NIV and NHF on SVB and haemodynamics were neutral during both night and daytime. Conclusions NHF does not correct sleep-disordered breathing in NMD patients with NH. Both NHF and NIV exert no immediate effects on SVB.",

            "text": "Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is indicated when respiratory muscle weakness is accompanied by nocturnal hypercapnia (NH) and sleep-related symptoms [11] , but long-term data on the effects of NIV in patients with slowly progressive NMD and mild NH are scarce and conflicting. For example, treatment adherence and therapeutic benefits have been reported to be low or indefinite in patients with DM1, in particular [12] . In this population, adherence to NIV has been shown to strongly depend on sleep-related symptoms and leakage of air or other respiratory-related issues [13] . With regard to other slowly progressing myopathies, no similar evidence has been collected to date, but based on own clinical observations a subset of patients with evolving NH and mild or even absent sleep-related complaints have considerable problems to tolerate nocturnal NIV. In these individuals, treatment-related inconveniences due to mask intolerance, air leakage, aerophagy and patient-ventilator dyssynchrony may be perceived as more serious than subjective symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). As long as NH is not severe, these patients might benefit from different ventilator settings or an alternative type of ventilatory support which is-potentially-easier to tolerate. First, spontaneous BiPAP mode (with mere inspiratory support) can be used in which no respiratory rate is specified and the risk of dyssynchrony is reduced accordingly. Second, nasal high-flow (NHF) oxygen therapy could be considered as a treatment alternative since it has previously been shown to exert beneficial effects on several aspects of ventilation and gas exchange. To date, NHF oxygen therapy has mainly been used for treatment of acute hypoxic respiratory failure where it improves pulmonary gas exchange and relieves shortness of breath [14] . But also in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and hypercapnic respiratory failure, NHF oxygen therapy has been reported to enhance oxygenation and reduce both respiratory rate and hypercapnia [14] [15] [16] [17] . Using special nasal prongs NHF supplies warm humidified air with a high flow rate. Apart from an increase of inspiratory oxygen concentration (if O 2 is supplemented), NHF is thought to generate flow-dependent positive airway pressure and reduce dead-space ventilation and CO 2 rebreathing from the nasopharynx and trachea [18] [19] [20] [21] . Only one case report has been published on the use of NHF in a patient with acute respiratory failure of neuromuscular origin [22] , and no evidence is available with regard to NMD patients with mere NH or chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure. Assuming that alveolar ventilation corresponds to tidal volume minus dead-space ventilation, improvement of CO 2 elimination can potentially be achieved by NHF in NMD patients with evolving NH.",

For assessment of SVB, diastolic blood pressure variability (dBPV) and heart rate variability (HRV) were analysed using the continuous noninvasive arterial blood pressure signal (CNAP\u00ae Technology, CNSystems, Graz, Austria; sampling rate 100 Hz) and a 3-lead electrocardiogram (sampling rate 1000 Hz), both implemented in the TFM\u00ae. Both HRV (based on continuous recording of variability in RR intervals) and dBPV were initially expressed in ms 2 but were then normalised for total power spectra with the unit being percent. Data were computed by frequency domain analysis (adaptive autoregressive parameter AAR model) and presented as the high-frequency component (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz), low-frequency component (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz) and their relative ratio (LF/HF) for both HRV and dBPV. A higher LF/HF ratio indicates increased sympathetic drive as the LF component (of dBPV variability in particular) is believed to reflect sympathetic activation, and the HF component (of both HRV and dBPV) is considered to reflect parasympathetic drive [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

One patient (male, 35 years of age) carried pathogenic mutations for both FSHD and DM1. Following daytime testing 16 out of 17 NMD patients participated in nocturnal assessment of NHF and NIV effects. Consistent with the previous diagnosis of NH, mean and peak p tc CO 2 were increased without NIV during night 1 (Table 1) . During the same night and without NIV, 4 (25.0%) patients showed moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea as reflected by an AHI > 15/h. Using NIV, 6 out of 16 patients (37.5%) showed normocapnia and normalization of the AHI throughout the intervention. In the remaining subjects, either pressure settings or minute volume had to be titrated in order to correct mild residual NH or sleep apnea, respectively.",

            "text": "The fact that NHF does not exert beneficial effects on sleeprelated breathing in patients with NMD suggests that mechanistic explanations for the improvement of gas exchange and upper airway stability by NHF cannot be proven in this subgroup. First, NHF apparently does not build up sufficient positive airway pressure to sufficiently stabilise the upper airway and to substantially reduce obstructive events. This finding is consistent with previous studies that showed that every 10 l of increase in NHF flow rate translate into a~1 cmH 2 O increase in positive airway pressure [19] . Second, the assumed reduction of dead-space ventilation due to NHF did not lead to a measurable improvement of CO 2 elimination. Previous studies have shown that NHF slows down respiratory rate and reduces dead-space ventilation, tidal volume and minute ventilation in healthy subjects during sleep [33] . With regard to patients, reduction of respiratory rate appears to be the most ostensible effect of NHF in adults and children [34, 35] . However, data on the effect of NHF on CO 2 tension are still conflicting. Continuous use of NHF (30 l/min flow rate) for 8 h has been shown to significantly lower capillary pCO 2 in awake patients with COPD by 0.69 \u00b1 0.2 kPa or 5.18 \u00b1 1.5 mmHg, respectively [34] . In contrast, transcutaneously measured tissue CO 2 did not fall after 10 min of NHF20 despite significant reduction of dead space [21] . Taking into account that NHF builds up only little positive airway pressure (~2 cmH 2 O with NHF20 and~5 cmH 2 O with NHF50)that, in addition, remains stable throughout the respiratory cycle-it seems plausible that NHF could not correct NH in this study. It should be acknowledged that NHF50 appeared to improve exhalation of CO 2 in those few NMD patients who did tolerate the intervention. However, differences did not reach significance most likely due to the small sample size. In summary, the mechanistic effects of NHF appear to be insufficient to improve upper airway patency and CO 2 exhalation in patients with NMD. In this context, it has to be considered as a major methodological aspect that the present study did not apply nasal high flow oxygen therapy but NHF Values are expressed as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range (in brackets) for sleep segments of 10-min duration taken from stable N2 sleep with sinus rhythm. Post hoc tests were not performed when results of multigroup comparisons were non-significant. Analysis of BRS data is based on 9/12 patients for up events and 10/12 patients for down events, respectively NHF nasal high flow, NIV non-invasive ventilation, BRS baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (up events and down events), HFnudBPV high-frequency component of diastolic blood pressure variability, HFnuRRI high-frequency component of heart rate variability, LFnudBPV low-frequency component of diastolic blood pressure variability, LF/HF dBPV relative ratio of low frequency and high frequency component of diastolic blood pressure variability, LFnuRRI low-frequency component of heart rate variability, LF/HF RRI relative ratio of low-frequency and high-frequency component of heart rate variability, n.s. not statistically significant, TPRI total peripheral resistance index 1) p values for comparison with baseline values (\"no treatment\") using either the paired t test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test as appropriate 2) p value for comparison between all groups/variables \u00a7 Kruskal-Wallis test & Univariate ANOVA alone. Combination of NHF with O 2 supplementation may predominantly account for improved oxygenation and reduction of respiratory rate which both have been reported in adult patients with acute respiratory failure and COPD. In children, low positive airway pressure levels as achievable by NHF may be sufficient to meaningfully reduce obstructive events [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] .",

            "text": "Application of NHF50 was poorly tolerated by patients with NMD in the present study. Tolerability was low both in the awake state during daytime and during nocturnal sleep. This finding seems to contradict previous studies that showed improvement of subjective well-being by NHF oxygen therapy with higher flow rates in patients with COPD, NMD or heart failure [14, 16, 18, 22, 41] . Two aspects may help explain these discrepant findings. First, beneficial effects of NHF were previously made in patients with acute dyspnea or in patients declining NIV therapy. In contrast, tolerability of NHF50 may obviously be hampered in non-dyspneic patients who mainly experience significant discomfort due to noise and nasal flow sensation. Second, improved oxygenation is likely perceived as directly relieving by patients with COPD or heart failure in whom hypoxic respiratory failure is also present. In particular, correction of hypoxia lowers sympathetic drive and reduces respiratory rate both leading to more efficient ventilation and clearance of CO 2 . ",

Firstly, the number of patients enrolled was too small to statistically deduce evidence which can reliably be generalised. However, this study aimed to provide (or falsify) a first-ever proof of principle regarding the use of NHF in NMD patients with NH. Secondly, duration of each intervention was a priori limited to about 2 h. It cannot be excluded that longer periods of NHF would have exerted different effects on the variables evaluated in this study. Thirdly, sympathetic drive was not measured invasively, e.g. by direct recording of muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Non-invasive recording of HRV and dBPV can only provide an overall estimate of SVB, including also the vagal component. However, close correlation between muscle sympathetic nerve activity and HRV/dBPV measures (LF/HF ratios in particular) has previously been shown [42, 43] .",

In contrast, all patients had started NIV substantially earlier including the opportunity to get used to it.
