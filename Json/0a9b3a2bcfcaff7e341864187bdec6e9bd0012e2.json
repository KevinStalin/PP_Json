For this purpose, Luhmann's theory will specifically be compared with Emile Durkheim's and Alfred Schutz's sociological theories. Durkheim, a \"child of the Enlightenment,\" considered freedom a collective ideal of moral individualism and conceived that the rational state realizes freedom by spreading the civil-religious human ideal for modern social order. In contrast, Schutz, following Henri Bergson, who criticized rationality for spatially fixing inner time, regarded freedom as a given in the individual's underlying duration, not as a shared ideal. Yet, unlike Bergson, he continued relying on rationalism, and he thought that the sociological observer observes how something appears to people with the epoch\u00e9 of natural attitude, not what it objectively is. Inheriting this phenomenological subjectivism, Luhmann showed that the self-referentiality of consciousness also applies to society: A social system, which path-dependently emerges itself from a double contingency, observes the world in its own way based on its self-referentially constituted eigen-time. On account of this system closure, and contrary to Durkheim's illuminist belief, there is no controlling entity in a highly evolved society, where freedom results from the enlarged, diversified possibilities of living experience and action (contingency). Thus, sociological enlightenment doubts self-evidence so that society brackets the taken-for-granted social order or social reality and amplifies individuals' deviations to evolve toward freedom.",

For this purpose, the following argument specifically relies on Niklas Luhmann's theory of social systems, which characterized sociology's contribution as sociological enlightenment, an enlightenment that enlarges the room for new kinds of \"living experience (Erleben)\" and \"action (Handeln)\" by revealing the path-dependency of the existing, taken-for-granted social order or social reality (cognitive order).

This condemnation recalls Karl Marx's aphorism in his Theses on Feuerbach. There are surely cases in which changing society is more important than interpreting (understanding) it. However, the impossibility of centralist planning (teleology) of a complex society has become apparent through the practice of Marxism. Even if society could be successfully changed based on such rationalist planning, the changed society would neither always be ideal for everyone nor remain in that condition without other changes in the future. In any case, the belief that there is a single normatively correct order, whether illuminist or obscurantist, could severely restrict freedom. Today, especially, since both the left and the right are keen to change society in some form, it seems meaningful to theoretically clarify how society changes on earth, apart from the encouragement of practice based on a particular normative ideal. Considering this issue in relation to individual freedom is the main aim of this article.",

For Luhmann, the lack of a privileged entity controlling all of society was evidence of a highly evolved society that has great complexity and also a considerable degree of contingency of the individual's living experience and action; individual freedom is socio-evolutionarily achieved as enlarged otherwiseness in living experience and action. His sociological enlightenment referred to doubting realities that are taken for granted in modern life so that society can bracket the path-dependent existing order and amplify deviations derived from the fluctuations of individuals. Sociology's task is not only to elucidate how social order gets constituted. It is also to indicate that the existing order is merely an accidental result of path-dependency and is therefore neither absolute nor invariant. In paying attention to this contingency of social order, Luhmann seems to have thought that sociology could help society to change itself and evolve toward freedom by showing other possible ways of life, not by instructively guiding to the sole correct(\u2212seeming) answer for social change.",

In reality, he had rather conceived himself to inherit the task of the Enlightenment since the beginning by proposing sociological enlightenment that reflexively clarifies the limits of the oldfashioned, reasonable Enlightenment (Luhmann [1967 . Nevertheless, the notion of sociological enlightenment that he proposed seemed to have remained unclear. Luhmann only formulated the core meaning of sociological enlightenment abstractly as \"the increase in human potentials for the grasp and reduction of world complexity through system-building\" (Luhmann [1967 , adding \"Unlike the reasonable Enlightenment, sociological enlightenment will no longer search for fixed, intersubjectively certain truths of reason and deduce everything else from them\" (Luhmann [1967 . These statements might lead to misunderstanding of sociological enlightenment as a part of social technology of state technocrats for stabilizing the existing system (or the status quo) (see, for instance, Habermas 1971: 260) . The following discussion will show the opposite implications of sociological enlightenment that will contribute to the evolutionary change of society for individual freedom. Therefore, I first cite as a comparative example a classic who attempted to legitimate the Enlightenment by sociology: Emile Durkheim, a \"child of the Enlightenment\" (Hughes 1958: 280) , who lived in the French Third Republic.",

Just as what makes a biological organism human is not the internal organs but the mind, the common ideal enables a social organism to establish a cooperative relationship among its functionally differentiated organs and to maintain the whole as a living society sui generis; Durkheim says, \"Isn't this ideal type, which each society asks its members to fulfil, the keystone of the whole social system and that which produces its unity?\" (Durkheim [1906 . For this reason, Durkheim described the set of ideals animating society and enabling its internal solidarity as \"society's soul (l'\u00e2me d'une soci\u00e9t\u00e9)\" (Durkheim [1925] 2012: 124, emphasis added). Note that this is different not only from religious morality before secularization (la\u00efcit\u00e9) but also from the people's spirit (Volksgeist; l'\u00e2me des peoples) that was assumed in the German organicist notion of community (Gemeinschaft). Contrary to Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies's assumption about morality in his Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft ([1887] 1922), Durkheim believed that the moral order of Gesellschaft is superior to that of Gemeinschaft: The society's soul-moral individualism-integrates civil society (Gesellschaft) as an organic whole despite its diversification, maximally realizing individuals' freedom and equality (see Tada 2020 ).",

His reaction to the Dreyfus Affair-a hate crime toward the minority in today's context-also derived from civil loyalty to the national credo of modern France, not from an ethnic solidarity with Jewish brothers. Durkheim hoped that society would be changed by state regulations to realize the modern ideal: (Durkheim [1950 (Durkheim [ ] 1995 For instance, Durkheim asserted that the state liberates the individual from a premodern collectivist life (Durkheim [1950 (Durkheim [ ] 1995 ; above all, the education system ought to be put under state supervision. School education must be conducted in conformity with the ideals of modern France (Durkheim 1922: 59-62) . Thus, public schools controlled by the state are required, as a secular institution of socialization differing from family or church so that children, the next generation of French society, can cultivate their own individuality and also grow to respect others' human dignity. Durkheim additionally conceived that international concord and the peace of mankind would be realized naturally, without the banner of cosmopolitanism, if an appropriate education of the universal ideal were provided in each country's national framework (Durkheim [1925 (Durkheim [ ] 2012 . 1 This aspect of Durkheim's thought is a case of methodological nationalism, and politically that of liberal nationalism: like Will Kymlicka (2001) , Durkheim had faith in modern Western values and ideals, the evolution of society toward their realization, and the need for state intervention in this process (see Adachi 2013: 67-90) . In other words, his social theory was oriented toward the idealized order that he saw as normatively desirable. 1 For instance, Durkheim certainly criticized Heinrich von Treitschke for his nationalist state theory in a war pamphlet (Durkheim 1915) . He also had acknowledged in a philosophical conference that the \"human fatherland (patrie humaine)\" was being formed in Europe (Durkheim [1908 . However, Durkheim did not always think that existing national fatherlands should be overcome by the human one: As an ideal, the latter just covers the former. Durkheim thus flatly denied such a notion that national fatherlands will (or must) be completely sublated by some borderless collective like an enlarged, \"internationalist\" classcommunity of proletariats. \"It is not difficult to make the worker understand that even her/his dearest aspirations always assume, as a necessary premise, a strongly organized fatherland; so much so that in trying to destroy fatherlands, s/he breaks with her/his own hands the only instrument that allows her/him to reach the goal s/he is striving for\" (Durkheim [1908 . For Durkheim, the civilized state that embodies modern ideals remained a realistic backing to achieve humanity and the peace of mankind.",

According to this contemporary of Durkheim, freedom (free will) exists in every individual's fluid inner duration, not a fixed and shared ideal. Bergson famously dismissed the confrontation between determinism and indeterminism as an apparent problem resulting from the spatialization of time (Bergson [1889] 1908: chap. 3). When arguing free will, both determinists and their opponents spatially represent a stream that has already flowed past and then deny or defend the contingency of human action. After thinking back to the action's starting point and reflectively visualizing other possibilities branching out from it, determinists allege that the action was predestined to be chosen because it was, in fact, selected over the others, while indeterminists conversely assert that the other actions were also possible because the action actually taken was still a considered choice. However, the time represented by both sides is always the one that has fictively flowed past, and is just an irreal, space-conceptually constructed symbol for the genuine lived time. That time is as good as a qualitatively homogenous time-scale in which neither actual human beings are living nor something creatively deviant from intelligence emerges.

Evolution phenomena through something like revolution or innovation are neither explainable by teleology according to which the destination is pre-set in advance, nor by a mechanism according to which the subsequent state of the world is always determined by the preceding one.

(Bergson [1889 (Bergson [ ] 1908 Freedom is originally given at the sensory level of each individual. Contrary to Durkheim, Bergson had in this respect an element of irrationalism, if not anti-intellectualism, in his free thought: Bergson believed that modern intellectuality or rationality, although seen as the transcendent emancipator, paradoxically restrains individuals' true freedom by reducing the original complexity of her/his inner time through its spatial simplification. Typically, positivism does this by intelligence; without seeing the genuine time of inner duration, modern science takes time as an independent variable and only repeats industrial manufacturing of the already-known, same object at best (Bergson [1907 (Bergson [ ] 1940 . That is, time descends into a mere calculating scale with which modern industry keeps efficient mass production. Bergson says, \"Precisely because it [intelligence] always seeks to reconstitute, and to reconstitute with the given, intelligence lets get away what is new at each moment of history. It does not admit the unpredictable. It rejects all creation\" (Bergson [1907] 1940: 177, emphasis in original). This was a reason why Bergson criticized modern-scientific rationalism for its reconstruction of time as the spatially calculable and insisted on a return to inner duration, which was given immediately to consciousness and not conceptually but only intuitively graspable. He also rejected Spencer's evolution theory as a spatial reconstruction and treated creative evolution, an ongoing process that leaps ahead based on the \u00e9lan vital in the present (see also Bergson [1907 Bergson [ ] 1909 .",

In system-theoretic terminology, the important thing here is, however, that inner time is far from an \"anything goes\" random walk. While the beginning is arbitrary, initial choices become self-bound and define the following process, to some degree. For instance, living experiences work themselves into the scheme of experience to determine the meaning of an ensuing living experience (Sch\u00fctz 1932: 86-89) . That is, to use a system-theoretic term again, path-dependency occurs in the course of consciousness (Tada 2013a: 254-256; Tada [2018] 2019). 2 Then, Schutz himself, while approving this underlying, path-dependent duration, maintained Weberian action theory's view of the modern individual who rationally acts toward the achievement of future goals s/he projects. An individual actor, as long as s/he is immersed in pure duration, is in the so-called \"epoch\u00e9 of the natural attitude\" (Schutz [1945 ) and has still not \"awakened.\" To be rational and genuinely autonomous, the actor must move away from inertial path-dependence and reflexively plan definite goals by intelligence and intermediate objectives by spatializing inner time (Tada 2013a: 118-119) . As Schutz says, the unit of an ongoing action (Handeln) is \"a function of the span of the project (Entwurf)\" (Sch\u00fctz 1932: 62, emphasis in original) . Therefore, a sociology of modern society should explore unit acts uniquely defined by modern individuals themselves rather than diversified duration. The action's aim that is rationally projected as a unit act is the action's subjective meaning, which sociology deals with.",

For instance, according to Luhmann, a successive process consisting of system elements \"generates through the intensification of selection, that is, through the temporal restriction of the freedom degree of elements\" (Luhmann 1984 : 610, emphasis added). A system element neither exists in itself alone like an atom nor appears at random, nor is it given by something external. Its meaning lies in relation to the other elements of the same system. That is, the meaning of an element is selectively determined as a now and so in the successive process (inner duration) consisting of other interrelated elements, and in turn, as a part of the process, it contributes to constitute new elements, giving a certain direction to the duration. Through such a self-regulative circulation, a self-referential system reproduces itself as a becoming reality, so to speak. Then, Luhmann, unlike Bergson and Schutz who focused on consciousness (conscious system), characteristically carried out theory-building at the macro-social level, defining the element of society as communication. Society, in his conception, is a spontaneous communicative order, dynamically stabilized on the basis of its own inner duration or eigen-time. 4 In a world of chaos, due to the lack of weighting among occurrence probabilities, 100 % is evenly divided among infinite possible events; hence, they are all equally and extremely improbable (unwahrscheinlich) and it is, of course, impossible to precalculate which of them will be chosen. Everything would appear at random without interrelatedness. In contrast, in real society, some specific events become self-evident and probable (wahrscheinlich) through the self-reinforcing temporal development of a path, despite the contingency of its beginning. That is to say: A path-dependent significant bias (a symmetry-broken iterative regularity) that emerges spontaneously from the world of chaos (the symmetry of all event probabilities) is an order and, accordingly, a system (Tada 2013a (Tada : 253-257, [2018 2019). 5 It is precisely the disposition (trend) of choice self-formed through its own temporality.",

This makes social criticism striving for alternatives possible but never means that society is in a defective condition with the ideal unfinished. In the case of a becoming reality, as Bergson ([1932 Bergson ([ ] 1937 indicated, it is a fallacy to believe the snapshot of an accidental resting state as essential and to look down on variability as defective. Furthermore, contrary to Durkheim's illuminist assumption about the state initiative for the organic whole in the social division of labor, Luhmann thought that the characteristic of modern society is the impossibility of a privileged authority controlling the functionally differentiated whole: the absence of a ruling head (a cerebrospinal system) is evidence of a highly evolved society. The freedom and equality of all systems are achieved in the sense that neither ideal, norm, nor rational government can control the whole of society. More fundamentally, they are already found in the notion of self-reference: freedom is a given in the inner duration of each system in the form of closed, autonomous self-reproduction.

Therefore, how freedom becomes possible in real society must be discussed within the theoretical framework of a self-referential system; 4 To borrow Georg Simmel's thought, society is not a being (society; Gesellschaft) but a becoming (sociation; Vergesellschaftung). See Tada (2013a: chap. 12). 5 Incidentally, quantitative and qualitative study make no fundamental difference with respect to focusing on this significant bias (Tada 2013a: chap. 7, fn. 3 and chap. 10, fn. 21 and 22). it is here that the social evolution enters the picture. Luhmann formulated the increasing possibilities for living experience and action (i.e., the growth of the number and variety of possible living experiences and actions) as the general tendency of social evolution (Luhmann 1971: 22) . This expresses the development from a simple society to a complex society, and, in addition, freedom would be established when an actor can act differently based on her/his own choices, although evolution specifies behavioral regulations and the actor also knows them, which are path-dependently normalized (see Luhmann [1978] 2008: 120). In other words, freedom exists in a society in which complexity at the social level can be translated into contingency at the individual level, that is, into the selectability of an unconventional living experience or action. In this sense, freedom (Freiheit) \"appears as the result of socio-cultural evolution\" (Luhmann [1978] 2008: 120).",

For instance, given the exclusion from a particular functional system such as education, one could also be excluded from other functional systems and, because of anxiety and fear concerning such a life course, one might even democratically choose an authoritarian regime as a desirable order. Considering the rise of totalitarianism in modernity or the current situation of the world, the form of functional differentiation does not itself prevent society from turning toward a reduction of otherwiseness in living experience and action. Put differently, an increase in complexity does not always lead to an increase in rationality in this world (Luhmann 1975c: 214) . Evolving into a better ideal is not promised.

Put simply, others are inherently black boxes, and there is no collective foundation leading to a perfect agreement or consensus. Only double contingency is always a given in social scenes. Since individuals exist autonomously based on their own inner durations, their living experiences and actions cannot be fully controlled from the outside. Yet, because of the necessary structural coupling with society, consciousness occupies a privileged position for intervention in communication (see Luhmann 1997: 114-115) . Luhmann thought that these conditions allowed a spontaneous social order to emerge, as well as the eventual evolution of society: individuals are not agents that change society but rather a noise source outside society and, because of autonomy, create fluctuations without necessarily intending to. A fluctuation is a sort of deviant difference-a deconstructive shift, one might say-that brings about variants in society. Individuals can make society unstable and lively in this manner (see Luhmann 1978 : 83-84). For example, they can say \"no\" as well as \"yes\" in communication (see Luhmann 1997 Luhmann : 229-230, 2005 Luhmann : 202-204, [1990 .

However, in this current, so-called risk society with an increasingly uncertain future, high homogeneity cannot adequately deal with unknown events due to its lack of flexibility. Besides, the cost of suppressing fluctuations would grow. In this complicated, rapidly metamorphosing world society, planning cannot be conducted in a linear-causally secure manner. 6 To be rational, one must rather amplify deviations from an existing channel that was taken for granted. In this light, today's prevailing mindset that innovation will be achieved through \"selection and concentration\"-a mindset that can be named national capitalism after national socialism-is devoid of rationality. As is the case with a planned economy, 7 this neo-liberal mindset is a \"fatal conceit\" that it is possible to reconstructively calculate all things by spatializing time. In reality, this vanity would ruin the seed of a deviant new combination or symbiotic relationship, thereby making it more improbable that an evolutionary leap occurs based on \u00e9lan vital. Creative evolution arises from an indiscriminately streaming mixture in the present, that is, from a diverse and fluid complexity beyond a reconstructive calculation 8 : \"assorted odds and ends\" must, even if appearing to be useless at the time, be retained because evolution \"feeds upon deviations from normal reproduction\" (Luhmann 1990b: 180) .

However, the system must produce both continuity and 6 With respect to planning, see Luhmann (1984 Luhmann ( : 635-638, 1990b . And as for the metamorphosis of world society, see Beck (2016) . 7 Hobsbawm ([1994] 1996: 411-413) and Graeber (2015) indicate the tendency for neo-liberal regimes to bloat bureaucratic works, such as documentary examinations to promote competition, and even to increase governmental expenditures due to nationalistic military expansion or poverty programs-poverty that was created by the government's own policies. It also follows that bureaucrats' powers grow. 8 As a suggestive work concerning this, see Florida (2012) and, theoretically, Arthur (2009). discontinuity within itself, provided that it is self-referential (see Luhmann 1975b: 155-156) . In other words, \"society changes\" means that society changes itself (sich \u00e4ndern). 9 Therefore, we should ask how unplanned structural change and, accordingly, diversification and complication become possible in society despite its operative closure (Luhmann 1993a: 240) ; in other words, how society can evolve by moving away from being submerged in the path-dependent pure duration and by replacing its own structure. As a matter of fact, returning to pure duration, as Bergson asserts, gives no guarantee that an individual's variant fluctuation turns into society's impulsive leap. Worse, the possibility even exists for the fluctuation to be oriented toward social devolution (retrogressive evolution). Rationality thus remains indispensable for social evolution, yet rational planning based on the reflection of the natural attitude would, as Schutz indicated about consciousness, result in a uniquely determined, self-bound state: As in the so-called first modernity, it could merely reduce a primordial diversity of the \"pure duration of society\" and make the otherwiseness of living experience and action more improbable. Unlike Durkheim, today, we cannot naively expect either that the central government enlightens society or helps it evolve. The will toward rational planning can expose individual freedom to the risk of unintended consequences, since it will by no means be realized as expected in this functionally differentiated, complex society.",

One is to inquire how a self-referential path-dependency (a spontaneous order) emerges from an accidental beginning (and how and what ideal or norm is chosen from there); this is formulated as the problem of social order. However, what is more important is the other: to doubt self-evidence. Its possible contribution to social evolution has been poorly understood. In actuality, it is inextricably linked to the problem of social order. That is, sociology reveals that the existing order deemed as self-evident and perhaps necessary is just a contingent order formed in a path-dependent manner, and thereby demonstrates the possibility of different living experiences and actions, as well as different ways of living. Thus, the discipline serves the evolution of society toward freedom by bracketing the \"epoch\u00e9 of the natural attitude\" in pure duration, not by planning or idealizing an order uniquely but by proving a fixed modern order to be contingent.

In this sense, the task of the theory of self-referential social systems is epistemological as well. In fact, Luhmann's theory inherits the phenomenological sociological view on the mundane world. As is known, Luhmann regarded self-referential social systems not as mere macro structural things (choses) confronting individuals but as autonomous observers who subjectively observe their environments from their own perspectives. What grounds a social system's own ability of observing its environment is the communicative intentionality. As Tada (2010 : 189, 9 Moeller (2006 shows a similar view. 2013a: chap. 2) clearly points out, communication, of which a social system consists, is always a communication of something, as phenomenology made a discovery about consciousness. There is a necessary intentional correlation between communication and external reality. Thus, while Durkheim (and Parsons, too) ontologically focuses on what the internal, ontological structure of society is, Luhmann poses an epistemological question about how each social system recognizes the external world. The inner side of a social system matters only for this task, because, as Schutz thought, how something external appears to a social system and why it appears so to the system now depends on the state of the inner time order of the system in question at that time (Tada [2018] 2019).",

Further, because of communicative intentionality, this subjectivist approach is nonreductively applicable to social systems as well. For instance, Schutz's term \"epoch\u00e9 of the natural attitude\" can directly correspond to Luhmann's term \"first-order observation\" (Yamaguchi 2002: 189; Tada 2010: 194) . According to Schutz, man in his natural attitude puts \"the doubt that the world and its objects might be otherwise than it appears to him\" (Schutz [1945 in brackets. Likewise, insofar as being a first-order observer, a social system is in its pure duration and takes the coming and going of communicationcorrelated (social) phenomena only \"as they give themselves,\" without taking into account contingency (Tada [2018] 2019: 1001). This first-order observer's attitude could be characterized as a na\u00efve-realist's one, in which the observed world appears as self-evident or even necessary. In contrast, Luhmann referred to the observer who observes the first-order observer as a second-order observer, who focuses on how something appears to a first-order observer subjectively in the now and so of her/his eigen-time, rather than what that something really objectively is.",

The social systems theory brackets the social reality (cognitive order) that first-order observers firmly take for granted. In other words, it always accomplishes a phenomenological reduction. Luhmann remarks, [In the social systems theory] it is not all about an interest in acknowledgment (Anerkennnung) and healing, nor about an interest in preserving the status quo, but first and foremost about an analytical interest: about breaking through the appearance of normality, about leaving aside experiences and habits, and in this (here non-transcendental theoretical) sense: about phenomenological reduction. (Luhmann 1984: 162) As already discussed, disorder is impossible and a social order necessarily emerges in a self-reinforcing manner. In other words, some spontaneous order generates and becomes normal. It then often works as an \"external and binding force\" (Durkheim) or an \"iron cage\" (Weber) in which people's freedom is limited; any new order, even if more complex, can increase new bindings as well as freedom again (see also Luhmann 1984: 435-436) . Therefore, if sociology seriously hopes to receive an inheritance from the Enlightenment, it cannot exclusively see the constitution of social order. At the same time, the deviation amplification from the existing, taken-for-granted order becomes one of sociology's contributions. Sociology searches for different possibilities that can emancipate the first-order observers from the ossified reality that appears invariant to and binds them.",

Contrary to the Spencerian worldview of the survival of the fittest, Luhmann originally conceived that other possibilities are not eradicated through selection but remain preserved in the meaning horizon. Even a variant option that was once denied as unfitting at a point in time is still retained and can be chosen anew and made probable (re-stabilized). Fluctuations springing from diversified individuals are in themselves accidental events that will vanish; for social evolution, they must be selected in society, path-dependently stabilized, and become probable and self-evident again (see Luhmann 1990a Luhmann : 556-561, 1990b Luhmann : 180, 1993a Luhmann : 240, 277-278, 1997 Luhmann : chap. 3, 2000 Luhmann : 408-412, 2005 . 10 Hence, sociology helps deviant fluctuations at the individual level gain social resonance through communication and acquire a socio-structural probability, insofar as they contribute to social evolution; thereby, society can use deviations as catalysts to reflexively find a way out of the path-dependent na\u00efve belief and to change itself self-critically.",

Such an elitist, enlightening desire, which homogenizes the social ideal by transcendently instructing from above or excluding supporters of an order \"undesired\" from its perspective as unenlightened people, is itself a social cleansing and the same as egoistic individualism that seeks to manipulate others. 11 Indeed, it would even be normal for people to feel disaffected or anxious and look for an object of wrath with collective effervescence if the life order (or lifeworld) they had taken for granted became uncertain through upheavals as in these days. Nevertheless, if one simply asks people to sacrificially endure such a situation for the ideal from above, it is not much different from the worldview of an all-out fight. In fact, both the right and the left, respectively believing themselves to be true, seek as progress the transition toward a desirable order for their worldview. This is because both sides, regardless of ideology (dogmatized ideal), share humanism-the overconfidence in human ability that human beings can and should control society politically, that is, socio-technologically (see Moeller 2012: chap. 3) . 12 However, to not recognize the reality that perfect social planning is impossible is nothing other than a lack of intelligence or enlightenment. Human beings cannot change this complex, self-referential society, as intended: Society has freedom from human beings. It should be recalled that, in sociology, Durkheim had already delivered his criticism to the reasonable Enlightenment's \"simplistic rationalism\" (Durkheim [1925 (Durkheim [ ] 2012 and \"anthropocentric postulate\" (Durkheim [1901 ] 1956 , regarding society as a reality sui generis with its own complexity (Durkheim [1925 (Durkheim [ ] 2012 . In this mundane world, everyone has only a selectively limited recognition with a blind spot. Neither \"planning for freedom\" (Karl Mannheim) nor the modernization of modernization by a sublime yet forced ideal can successfully alter society as intended. Rather, any enforcement could make individuals reflective and \"awake\" in the direction of their crowding into reactionary fluctuation or their seeking an irrational purpose through rational planning, as Schutz ([1957 warned of a \"vicious circle,\" a negative spiral, between both camps. Such an unintended consequence can really happen if individuals are autonomous and diversified.",

Even liberal leftists are no exception: they sometimes bash the working class, based on the prejudice that working-class people are racists, ignoring both their ethnic diversity and class difficulties. That being so, it is not always unreasonable that such people challenged by a \"class war from above\" have antipathy toward the establishment, and recent populism in the West can also be considered subpolitics against a path-dependently re-feudalized society. 12 In addition, Moeller (2012: 28-31) positively evaluates as a \"sociological insult\" Luhmann's radical functionalist viewpoint, which denies such socio-technological vanity. opposed to excluding 13 : the understanding sociology (verstehende Soziologie) in a literal sense. However, as Weber ([1919] 1988: 503) also stated, understanding in this context means neither forgiveness nor approval; nor is it the clich\u00e9 of pluralism (or multiculturalism) as the normatively correct answer. 14 Rather, as discussed above, sociological enlightenment reveals the absence of one absolute, enlightening solution. In brief, it does not guide to the correct answer instructively but shows another perspective that is different from the one taken for granted as correct. Through understanding, it finds the limitations and blind spots of the first-order observers' recognition and thereby shifts the way of seeing that they believe to be self-evident and even necessary.",

It may be said that modern society based on the value of contingency is normatively oriented toward differentiation rather than integration (Tada 2013a: 306) . In fact, discussions about how to change society are also made possible only under the premise that the present society could be otherwise.

Accordingly, sociology would be required to compare policies or behaviors in terms of whether they amplify otherwiseness; however, their belonging to liberalism, socialism, or conservativism does not matter in and of itself. Rather, no matter how lofty an ideal is, its dogmatization or fundamentalization leads to the devolution of society-even moral individualism, a modern belief in individual freedom, can oppress a religious minority in some situations today, being connected with the ultra-laicism (see also Tada 2020) . 17 In contrast, sociology that believes in contingency could state, as a pun on Rosa Luxemburg's words, that freedom is always the freedom in the differently thinking society (Freiheit ist immer die Freiheit in der andersdenkenden Gesellschaft). Then, to widen the range of otherwiseness in living experience and action, it is more relevant to comparatively evaluate everything in terms of the contributions made to social evolution and, if needed, to revise or exchange the existing option.

            "text": "These implications of Luhmann's social systems theory for social evolution seem to have been almost overlooked. This systems theory is by no means the stabilizing technology of dominance the Frankfurt school's critical theorist accuses it of being. Conversely, it consistently aims to destabilize and make dynamic the existing order under the premise that the current state of society is exchangeable and reformable. Moreover, this orientation is always directed at helping society evolve rather than devolve, that is, to increase possible living experiences and actions in society. 18 Thus, systems theory still works with enlightenment and rationality, but, as argued above, is no longer reasonable enlightenment from above. To this point, Durkheim's statement about the role of sociology is relevant: This one [social science], as with any science, studies that which is and that which was, looking for the laws, but disassociates itself from the future. [\u2026] Practical difficulties can be definitively settled only through the practice, through the experience of every day. It is not a meeting of sociologists but the societies themselves that find the solution. (Durkheim [1890 17 Symbolically, even Durkheim insisted that \"[t]here could not be a question of granting to the majority the right to impose its [illuminative] ideas on the children of the minority\" (Durkheim 1922: 62) . In contrast, sociological enlightenment would mainly target the majority, not minorities: Since existing self-evidences in society are usually the ones for the majority, it is rather the majority who must be first sociologically enlightened. Yet, sociological enlightenment should not be an elitist \"enlightenment from above.\" What I discussed above as understanding is related to this point. 18 Sociological enlightenment is, of course, directed at the socio-economic divide as well. As Frank and Cook (1995) have clearly shown, a small difference in the beginning could self-reinforcingly produce a striking disparity later, as success breeds success: the Matthew Effect, in Robert K. Merton's words. Seeing that even the initial condition of \"competition\" is unequal (asymmetrical), such path-dependency that cumulatively enlarges the rich-poor gap, restricting a group of people's possibilities of living experiences and actions in their life-courses, can neither be overlooked nor justified in terms of social evolution.",

            "text": "Contrary to the assumption of the reasonable enlightenment thinker, Durkheim thought that sociologists should not decide how society should change but leave that to the free choice of society itself. However, at the same time, he found it beneficial for sociologists to apply their reflections to actual matters, based on scientific results, and that the reflections reach people other than scientists, for instance, persons of action, as well (see Durkheim [1890 . This is one of the practical roles of sociology in the social division of labor. 19 To begin with, social division of labor refers to the exchange of differences among people (and, accordingly, interdependence among them) on the premise of limited human ability; this was the reason that Durkheim aspired after moral individualism. The limit of human capability and, therefore, the individual selectivity of perspective are a prerequisite for the evolution of society, since they mean individuals' individuality and its fundamental diversity. Therefore, as opposed to any kind of normative theory, sociological enlightenment amplifies deviations by bracketing the immobilized epoch\u00e9 of the natural attitude so that society evolves itself further toward freedom.",

I appreciate the insightful comments made by the participants at the symposium. I am particularly grateful to the other presenters, Prof. Yasutaka Ichinokawa (University of Tokyo, Komaba) and Prof. Yutaka Koyama (Toyo University); the debater, Prof. Midori It\u014d (\u014ctsuma Women's University); and the chairperson and co-organizer, Prof. Tomohiko Asano (Tokyo Gakugei University). Without their kind collaboration and stimulating discussions, this paper would never have been written. I also extend my thanks go as well to the editor and reviewers of The American Sociologist for their useful comments and advice. Finally, I would like to thank all the people I met during my research stays in Berlin in the past years, especially at the Technical University of Berlin, conferences or workshops, language courses, the university dormitory, events or festivals, while conducting \"field work\" in the city, and at Frank's Beerbaboon. Indeed, the essential ideas in this article derive from encounters with them and the free atmosphere of that city.Data Availability Not Applicable.",
