Besides their individual risk for head and neck cancer, smoking is now a major risk factor for transmitting SARS-Cov 2. They do not use the mask properly to smoke and tobacco fume may carry the virus. In addition, during smoking, the individual often touches his/her face with uncleaned hands. After smoking, they do not wash their hands and this may increase the risk of contaminating another person. Another problem is contaminated litter in the street, as they usually drop the cigarette but without care. 10 Thus, head and neck surgeons have an additional reason to advise smoking cessation this season: Please, don't smoke and stop spreading COVID-19!",
