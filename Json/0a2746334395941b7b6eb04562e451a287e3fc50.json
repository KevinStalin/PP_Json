For example, in the U.K. the government had been criticized for not acting decisively, and there was a genuine concern that London could turn into Bergamo, Italy, where demand for acute care outpaced capacity. Predictions in London suggested a shortfall of up to 7000 ventilated beds, published experience suggested intensive care length of stay of 7 to 14 days, and it was thought that in many patients the disease was largely respiratory. 3 In this situation, both technical and political considerations argued for establishing extra capacity.",

( We dismiss mixed Covid-19-positive and non-Covid-19 care because of crosscontamination risk.) There are several potential advantages to a Covid-19-free facility: staff do not require PPE to the degree that is needed in a Covid-19 facility; patients are theoretically safe from hospital-acquired Covid-19 infection; and the public perceives the facility as safe. The last consideration could be particularly important for persuading patients not to delay emergent and non-emergent care for treatable medical conditions such as coronary artery disease, stroke, and intra-abdominal infections.4 Failure to treat these conditions can increase the indirect mortality and morbidity rates from the pandemic. The original plans for U.S. Naval Hospital ships and the Javits Center in New York City were to provide non-Covid-19 care.",

Given the unknown number of patients who are infected but asymptomatic and questions about the reliability of testing, it is clear that creating a facility truly free from Covid-19 among both patients and staff is not possible at this time. An additional limitation is that a non-Covid-19 ACS requires a full spectrum of general acute-care hospital capabilities. Re-creating a brand-new full spectrum acute-care facility would create significant demands on the local healthcare system where staff are being redeployed to cover Covid-19-related care. Given these challenges, it is not surprising that both the USNS Comfort's mission to New York City and the Javits Center converted to Covid-19 treatment facilities because infection was noted in crew members in theComfort5 and the Javits Center stood empty days after opening as a non-Covid-19 facility.6",

FEMA has created three ACS models for delivering various levels of care. If the concern is an inadequate supply of ICU beds for ventilated patients, as was the case with the development of the Nightingale Hospital facility in the ExCel convention center in London, an intensive care focused model (FEMA's Acute Care ACS model1) is appropriate. If the community has a general shortage of acute-care hospital capacity, there are two alternative care models. FEMA's Hospital Care ACS model,1 is appropriate for creating additional capacity for the full spectrum of Covid-19 care, as was the case with the DCU Center Field Hospital7 in Worcester, Massachusetts. FEMA' s Non-Acute Care ACS model1 is appropriate for relocating lower-acuity Covid-19 patients to preserve acute-care hospital capacity for the sickest Covid-19 patients, as in the Boston Hope Medical Center in the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center.",

An intensive-care focused Acute Care model, as in the Nightingale Hospital in London, creates the potential to concentrate expertise in respiratory care to deal with the sickest Covid-19 patients -an imperative when early estimates suggested a significant shortfall in ICU capacity in greater London. But we now know Covid-19 is not a single-system disease. Renal, hematological and cardiac complications require a wide array of specialists to be available. In addition, creating an intensive-care-focused model requires the development of highly equipped facilities which take more time and cost to build out. Moreover, highly skilled teams are difficult to staff from available clinicians and volunteers who may or may not have critical care expertise.
