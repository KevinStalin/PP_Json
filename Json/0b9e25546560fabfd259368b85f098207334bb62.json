In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of 9-O position modified BBR derivatives aiming to improve its cell permeability and anticancer activity, utilizing a long alkyl chain branched by hydroxyl group and methoxycarbonyl group. Among these compounds, B10 showed 3.6-fold higher intracellular concentration than BBR, as well as 60-fold increased anti-proliferation activity against human lung cancer A549 cells compared with BBR. Treatment with B10 (1, 2 \u03bcM) induced apoptosis of A549 cells. Further investigations showed that B10 treatment dose-dependently affected mitochondrial functions, including oxygen consumption rate (OCR), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and the morphology of mitochondria in A549 cells. Therefore, this work offers a new way for BBR structural modification through improving cell membrane permeability to affect mitochondrial functions and potential anti-tumor therapy in the future.",

For example, the expression of E-cadherin, which is a significant mediator that regulates cell-cell adhesion and is an important molecule for maintaining the morphological and structural integrity of epithelial cells, can be enhanced by BBR in A549 lung cancer cells [18] . BBR also inhibits the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, an important class of proteins involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix barrier, as the first step in tumor cell metastasis [19, 20] . Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a vital role in tumor cell neovascularization. BBR shows an inhibitory effect on VEGF expression in the melanoma cell line B16F-10 [21, 22] . In colon cancer cells, BBR can significantly inhibit the synthesis of COX-2 and block the activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway induced by COX-2, thereby inhibiting the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells [23] . Moreover, BBR affects apoptosis-related proteins and pathways, which lead to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and the induction of tumor cell apoptosis. Caspase can be activated by BBR on different tumor cells [24] [25] [26] . In addition, BBR inhibits the proliferation of various tumor cells by inducing cell cycle arrest in in vitro cell experiments [27] [28] [29] .",

            "text": "We tested the activity of compound B1 on the A549 cell line (Table 1) , and the results showed a considerable increase in potency (8.6 \u03bcM) compared with BBR (54.5 \u03bcM). Compound B1 showed a dramatic increase in cLog P (cLog P = 3.175) compared with BBR (cLog P = \u22120.771), indicating that B1 might have better lipophilicity and cell membrane permeability. BBR can inhibit cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and achieves complete suppression at the concentration of 60 \u03bcM [33] . To investigate whether B1 could inhibit cell proliferation as well, A549 cells were incubated in the absence and presence of increasing concentrations of drug (0.5, 1 \u03bcM) for 24, 48 and 72 h. BBR and ETC-1002 had no obvious effect on A549 cells (Fig. 2a, b) . However, at the same concentration, B1 had a dose-and timedependent effect on cell proliferation (Fig. 2c) . We speculated that one of the reasons might be the improved permeability. our speculation, we conducted a cell membrane permeability experiment in which A549 cells were incubated with BBR and B1 (5 \u03bcM) for 8 h. The results showed that the concentration of intracellular compound B1 was higher than that of intracellular BBR, which was consistent with the IC 50 value (Fig. 2e) . Therefore, we found a compound (B1) with better permeability and antitumor activity than BBR. Encouraged by the results above, we next introduced different side chain substitutions with the same length of 15 carbons to further investigate the SAR. After deprotecting the methyl group, the acid from compound B2 completely lost its activity, revealing that the ester moiety was important to maintain the anticancer activity in A549 cells. To simplify the structure, the four \u03b1-methyl groups were removed, and compounds B3-B7 were designed and synthesized. Unfortunately, all of them showed dramatic declines in their IC 50 values toward A549 cells compared with B1. Several of the compounds were completely inactive. The above results indicated that the \u03b1methyl groups were beneficial for maintaining the activity. Amide derivatives B8 and B9 both displayed weaker activity compared to B1, indicating the importance of the oxygen at the 9-position. We then kept the 9-position oxygen to synthesize ester derivatives B10 and B11. To our surprise, compound B10 exhibited a 60-fold increase in activity compared to BBR (IC 50 = 0.9 \u03bcM). In addition, the acid form compound B11 had no activity in accordance with the above SAR. We selected compound B10 with good potency to test its effects on cell proliferation and cell membrane permeability. As shown in Fig. 2d , B10 significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of B10 was stronger than that of B1, which matched well with their IC 50 values in A549 cells. We also evaluated the activity of compounds B2 and B11 in the MTS assay ( Supplementary Fig. S1a, b) , and compounds B2 and B11 showed no inhibitory effect. There was no doubt that the permeability experiment showed that the concentration of intracellular compound B10 was higher than that of BBR (Fig. 2f) . The membrane permeabilities of compounds B2 and B11 were worse than that of BBR, which demonstrated that the increase in activity was correlated with the increase in permeability (Supplementary Fig. S1c) . Due to the positive charge on BBR and its derivatives, they could accumulate into the mitochondria, driven by the strong negative charge on the mitochondrial inner membrane. Moreover, mitochondria play a vital role in the physiological activity of BBR. As a membrane fluorescent potential-dependent mitochondrial indicator dye, TMRE fluorescence would increase with the enlarged MMP difference and vice versa, which could reflect the morphology and membrane potential of the mitochondria. To confirm the effect of the compounds on the mitochondria, we investigated the effects of B1, B10 and BBR on mitochondria via TMRE MMP experiments and fluorescence microscopy experiments.",

The MMP was almost fully lost after treatment with high concentrations of B10 (10 \u03bcM). In the fluorescence microscopy experiment, the results confirmed that B10 could lower the MMP in a dose-dependent manner, and the fluorescent signal of TMRE fully disappeared at the 10 \u03bcM concentration of B10, which was much stronger than that of B1. In addition, the fluorescence intensity had no obvious change with BBR treatment, indicating that BBR had no effect on MMP at this concentration (Fig. 3a) . In addition, we noticed that treatment with B1 and B10 could lead to changes in mitochondrial morphology. BBR can induce mitochondrial structure collapse and fragmentation at 60 \u03bcM in HepG2 cells [33] . Our results showed that 10 \u03bcM B1 could slightly change the mitochondrial morphology, while 2.5 \u03bcM B10 initiated significant mitochondrial fragmentation. On the other hand, 10 \u03bcM BBR treatment had no obvious effects on mitochondrial morphology, as indicated in Fig. 4 . These results revealed that B1 and B10 could influence mitochondrial functions and change the normal mitochondrial structure, which could finally lead to the death of cancer cells.",

The OCR dramatically decreased in a dosedependent manner after treatment with compound B1. In summary, the anticancer activity of compound B1 was better than BBR. Compound B10 significantly caused a decline in the OCR at the lowest concentration (5 \u03bcM) and lead to a sharp and rapid loss of OCR, reaching 30% after 10 min of incubation with high concentration treatment (>20 \u03bcM). In addition, the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP did not elicit the full percent of oligomycin-blocked ETC respiration, indicating that the ETC respiration capacity of treated A549 cells was suppressed by compound B10 in a dose-dependent manner.

BBR has been reported to induce apoptosis in SiHa and HeLa cells at doses of 100 \u03bcg/mL (297.6 \u03bcM) and 250 \u03bcg/mL (744.0 \u03bcM). In our case, we conducted flow cytometry to evaluate whether B10 could promote A549 apoptosis with a higher capability than BBR. We chose 1 \u03bcM and 2 \u03bcM to maintain consistency with the proliferation inhibitory assay, in which 24 h was the intermediate duration of treatment. As shown in Fig. 6a , the percent of apoptotic cells was significantly increased after B10 treatment for 24 h in a dose-dependent manner, and B10 showed increased potency compared to BBR (Fig. 6a) . To further confirm the induced apoptotic mechanism, A549 cells were treated with BBR and B10 to examine the effect on caspase-3 cleavage by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 6b , significant caspase-3 cleavage was observed after B10 treatment, which indicated that B10 induced A549 cell apoptosis. Mitochondrial membrane depolarization is an early event in apoptosis. Cytosolic cytochrome c was necessary for the initiation of the apoptotic program. B10 treatment induced A549 cell apoptosis, so we next detected the levels of mitochondrial proteins related to apoptosis. After B10 treatment for 24 h, the expressions of Bcl-2 and MCL-1, the key proteins that prevent apoptosis, were much lower than the levels in the control group as well as the levels in the BBRtreated group (Fig. 6b ). More importantly, the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm was much greater than in the control group after B10 treatment. These experiments showed that B10 induces apoptosis in A549 cells and that this induction may be associated with the modulation of mitochondria.",

            "text": "Although BBR may be used as a lead compound for the prevention of human cancer, the poor druggability of BBR has limited its applications. Inspired by previous studies of BBR derivatives, we introduced long chains at the 9-position to design and synthesize derivatives (B1-B11) that possessed different substituent groups, such as hydroxyl and methoxycarbonyl. Among these derivatives, compound B10 showed dramatically increased anti-proliferative activity compared with BBR. Various factors can lead to this phenotype. First, the physical properties and accessibility to cells were considered. We detected the intracellular concentration after treatment for 8 h. B1 and B10 both showed significantly higher concentrations compared to BBR due to the introduction of the lipophilic side chains at the 9position. Thus, higher activities and druggability became possible and were deserving of further research. Second, the positive charges as another physical property of the compounds were taken into consideration. Positively charged BBR accumulates in the negatively charged inner membrane of the mitochondria. Thus, we assumed that the derivatives could also accumulate in and affect the mitochondria. In addition to the generation of reactive oxygen species, oxidation and reduction of materials and regulation of related signaling, mitochondria, as the energy plant of the whole cell, generates ATP to maintain physiological activities through aerobic respiration. Furthermore, for cancer cells, the specific role varies according to both genetic and environmental factors. Generally, mitochondrial metabolism, bioenergetics, oxidative stress regulation, fission and fusion dynamics, cell death susceptibility, mitochondria biogenesis, turnover, and retrograde signaling can all contribute as mediators of tumorigenesis. The roles of mitochondria differ with different stages of cancer proliferation [44] . During the initial stages of cancer, genesis can be induced by oxidative stress and signaling pathway alterations in mitochondria. Then, in the growth stage, in addition to the factors mentioned above, mitochondria biogenesis and structural dynamics can be involved. During the survival stage, mitochondria may experience metabolic reprogramming and morphological changes. In the metastasis stage, reprogramming, biogenesis and dynamics are considered to be relative. Recent experimental results indicate that the mitochondrial ultrastructure is involved in the relationship between the bioenergetics and apoptotic (cell life/death decision) roles of mitochondria [45] . The drop in the MMP and ETC respiration rate is the first stage of the apoptosis process by mediation of cytochrome c release. In these processes, the imbalanced distributions of protons and other various ions contribute to the MMP between the two sides of the inner membrane to store energy. Stable MMP is necessary for oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation. Thus, the MMP assay was regarded as a classical evaluation method for mitochondrial function, in which we chose the potential-related fluorescent dye TMRE to indicate. The intracellular intensity of TMRE is positively correlated to the MMP. Not surprisingly, B10 represented a significant ability to reduce the MMP compared to BBR and B1, indicating more severe mitochondrial dysfunction.",

In the MMP assay, fluorescent images indicated that not only did the MMP decrease, but the structures of some mitochondria were also altered after treatment with B10. To further confirm this morphological change with relatively stable intensity, we turned to Mito Tracker Green as an MMP-independent mitochondria labeling tool. In representative images, mitochondria lost their clear and web-like structures in the blank control group, tending to be obscure and dot-like after treatment with B10, especially in the relatively high dose groups. Thus, these two aspects-MMP and morphology-reflected the negative effects on mitochondria caused by B10, which could lead to obstacles in energy generation, mutual cooperation or dynamic balance among the mitochondria. OCR detection representing respiration capability also consisted of the assumptions mentioned above. On one hand, damages to the energy-generation ability may fail to meet the requirements of cell activities; thus, apoptosis may be induced; on the other hand, the initial anti-proliferative effects observed can also result from enhanced apoptosis. Thus, the apoptosis rate was compared with the control group after treatment with compounds by flow cytometry. The results showed that the rates of apoptosis were significantly improved after treatment with B10 compared to both the blank control group and BBR group.",
