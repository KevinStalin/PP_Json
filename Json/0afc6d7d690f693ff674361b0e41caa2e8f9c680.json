Residual LRT samples obtained from 23 critically ill COVID-19 patients with predetermined microbiological culture results were 24 tested using the Unyvero HPN Application. Performance evaluation of the HPN Application 25 was carried out using the standard-of-care (SoC) microbiological culture findings as the 26 reference method. Eighty-three LRT samples were used in the evaluation. The HPN 27 Application had a full concordance with SoC findings in 59/83 (71%) samples. The new 28 method detected additional bacterial species in 21 (25%) and failed at detecting a bacterial 29 species present in lower respiratory culture in 3 (3.6%) samples. Overall the sensitivity, 30 specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the HPN Application were 95.1% 31 (95%CI: 96.5-98.3%); 98.3% (95% CI: 97.5-98.9%); 71.6% (95% CI: 61.0-80.3%) and 32 99.8% (95% CI: 99.3-99.9%) respectively.

Early and accurate identification of the infectious 56 etiology causing LRTIs is crucial for deciding the course of treatment with reference to 57 selection of appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy among 58 patients with more severe form of LRTIs, such as community-and ventilator-associated 59 pneumonia has been reported to reduce the length of hospital-stay, health care costs and 60 adverse clinical outcomes [1]. Historically, etiological diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia has 61 primarily been based on the microbiological culture findings. Minimum turn-around time for 62 results from the time of sample inoculation for culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing 63 is approximately 36-48 hours. Sensitivity of the microbiological culture techniques for 64 recovery of bacterial pathogens from lower respiratory tract samples can be hindered by 65 several factors including: i) prior administration of antibiotics; ii) poor quality and low 66 quantity of the sample; iii) overgrowth of commensal respiratory tract microbiota; iv) 67 technical expertise of the microbiologist reading the culture plates. Semi-quantitative cultures 68 of respiratory samples often cannot distinguish colonizer from pathogen. This problem can be 69 overcome by using quantitative culture techniques that are more conclusive but are more 70 laborious and cumbersome to perform. 71",

Furthermore, the HPN Application demonstrated high 263 negative predictive value of 99.8%, which would allow for reduction in unnecessary antibiotic 264 use and support antibiotic stewardship efforts. Given this context, perhaps prospective 265 diagnostic trials in the near future may assess the true positive predictive values of the 266 Unyvero HPN Application and other similar commercially available molecular RDTs. 267 268 Our study has a few limitations. Currently, we do not have the clinical data of the patients 269 from whom the present study samples were obtained. Because of this we could not determine 270 the: i) the proportion of samples that were sent to the microbiology laboratory prior the 271 administration of antibiotics; ii) the proportion of samples that were false positive by the HPN 272 Application due to the detection of bacterial DNA from a past infection. Another limitation of 273 the present study is that we could not determine the performance characteristics of the HPN 274 Application for the detection of genes conferring antimicrobial resistance, due to the fact that 275 only few samples yielded drug resistant phenotypes by culture in this study cohort (data not 276 shown here). Despite these limitations, our study identified that the Unyvero HPN 277 Application is a reliable and rapid diagnostic test with excellent negative predictive value for 278 detection of bacterial pathogens from lower respiratory tract samples. 279 280 In conclusion, rapid diagnostics such as the Unyvero HPN panel are imperative to evaluate 281 and test patients for bacterial pneumonia earlier in their hospital journey for more prompt and 282 appropriate treatment.

It is most likely possible that the bacterial super-226 infections among COVID-19 patients admitted to critical care units are due to the longer 227 durations of stay in the ICU and mechanical ventilation, rather than the viral infection itself, 228 but nonetheless this requires diligent microbiological testing because the signs and symptoms 229 can be similar and confounding. Given this context, the Unyvero HPN Application can be a 230 potential RDT of choice, considering that the HPN panel is able to detect 20 bacterial species, 231 one fungus and 17 antimicrobial resistance genes (Table 1), that includes the most common 232 infectious etiology of both healthcare-and ventilator-associated pneumonia. 233 In general, diagnostic yields from LRT samples vary with the sample type used. Invasive 235 samples such as BAL and PSB are considered to have a better yield of the causative etiology 236 of respiratory infections, as compared with non-invasive samples such as sputum. Diagnostic 237 thresholds for various LRT samples among patients with health-care acquired pneumonia 238 sputum [11]. A very low yield of pathogens from sputum samples of hospitalized patients 240 with severe form of COVID-19 was recently reported [12]. Invasive sampling techniques 241 have been contraindicated among COVID-19 patients outside the intensive-care units, due to 242 the risk of aerosol generation. In the present study, tracheal aspirate was the predominant (61, 243 73.5%) sample type used. Nevertheless, we also included 19 (23%) BAL or PSB samples 244 among which four (one BAL and 3 PSB) samples had a bacterial species, isolated by culture 245 CFU/mL. The Unyvero HPN Application flagged all these four samples as 246 negative (Table 2). Considering the lower diagnostic threshold, recommended for PSB 247 samples in comparison with other sample types (aforementioned), diagnostic efficacy of the 248 HPN Application for PSB samples in particular, needs further evaluation. 249 In our study, the HPN Application detected additional bacterial species among 21/83 (25.3%) 251 samples tested. This finding is in concordance with previous studies that have reported a 252 similar increase in the bacterial yield from LRT samples, using other molecular detection 253 assays among non-COVID-19 patients [13-15]. Currently, the clinical implications of 254",
