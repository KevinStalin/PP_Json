As the disease is spreading through interaction and no proper medicine is available till now, so minimizing the social distance and interaction among the people is only way to minimize the spreading of disease. To maintain social distancing, the China Government adopted the lockdown policy and is able to control the spreading of the disease [17, 18] . Following this policy, every country is adopting this policy except some countries.",

So the present impor-tant issue throughout the World is protecting the human society from this infection. In this context, some preventive measures such as maintaining social distance, wearing masks, frequently washing the hands with soap and water, etc., can be employed to protect human from this infection. Among the COVID-19 preventives, maintaining social distance plays an crucial role to protect from the infection. Social distancing means keeping a safe space among the peoples who are not their house hold [19] . The measurement of this social distance should be at least six feet [19] . In real field, a portion of the population always maintain social distance to avoid infection in the endemic period due to their awareness. In order to study the impact of this important factor (social distance) on the disease dynamics, we have incorporated it in our model.",

Actually, the COVID-19 outbreak starts in India from 1 March 2020, as from that date the new infected cases are reported continuously. On the other hand, a major preventive measure was taken by the Government of India by implementing a countrywide lockdown from 25 March 2020 and which has been continuing upto 17 May 2020 and may continue further if necessary. So we consider two sets of data: first one (set-1) is the collection of the cases reported during the period 1 March to 24 April of 2020. But before the implementation of lockdown (25 March 2020) many, exposed, symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infected person come in India from other COVID-19 pandemic countries, who are neither detected nor reported properly. So there remain uncertainty among the data reported during the period 1 March to 24 March 2020. Thus, we consider the second set (set-2) of data reported during the period 25 March to 24 April 2020 by avoiding the data reported in above said period. We have fitted the model to both the sets of data. The fitting to the first set is presented in Fig. 2a , b, and the estimated parameters are summarised in Table  2 , whereas the fitting of the second set is presented in Fig. 3a , b, and the corresponding parameters are put in Table 3 .

So the second set is the best fitting compared to the first set. Secondly, many exposed, asymptomatic infected, symptomatic infected persons came to India before on 25 March 2020 (before the lockdown) from other COVID-19 affected countries which are not detected properly. So there is uncertainty in reported data before 25 March 2020. So, we are not considering the data which reported before on that date. Thirdly from Fig. 4a and b , it is clear that the prediction based on second set of parameters is more perfect compared to the first one. For the above said reason, we shall choose the second set of parametric values which are estimated from the data reported from 25 March to 24 April 2020 to study the future trend of the outbreak and for model prediction.",

On the other hand, an asymptomatic infected human has no symptom, but he/ she is able to transmit the virus to other susceptible human. So susceptible person will not take or take in late (after diagnostic test) prevention measure to protect from the virus transmission from an asymptomatic infected person. In this context, our finding shows that approximately 45% of the infected population are asymptomatic. The time series of different infected populations (see Fig.  5b ) show that the number of daily asymptomatic infected population is larger than other infected population. The contribution on basic reproduction number of asymptomatic infected class is larger than other compartment. So protection of the virus transmission from asymptomatic infected class is a challenging problem for India like highly populated country.",

Our another observation is that according to our estimation the rate of hospitalisation from non-quarantine infected (\u03b7 i ) and quarantine infected classes \u03b7 q are 0.26 and 0.40, respectively. We have to increase these rate to control the COVID-19 outbreak.

The first set contains the cases reported during the period 1 March to 24 April 2020. On the other hand before the implementation of lockdown (25 March 2020), many symptomatic as well as asymptomatic infected person came into India from other COVID-19 pandemic country which are neither detected nor reported properly. So there remain uncertainty among the data reported during the period 1 March to 24 March 2020. Thus, we consider the second set of data reported during the period 25 March to 24 April 2020 by avoiding the data reported in above said period. We have fitted the model to the both sets of data and estimate two sets of parameters. Using the estimated parameter (from set-2), we compute the average basic reproduction number which is R 0 = 2.414190966 among which the contributions of asymptomatic, symptomatic, quarantine, hospitalise infected classes are R 0 A = 1.842473415, R 0I = 0.3910030945, R 0Q = 0.01860012179, R 0H = 0.162 1143316, respectively. According to our sensitivity analysis, the virus transmission rate (\u03b2), lockdown effect (d), proportion of infection rate of asymptomatic class in compare to symptomatic class (\u03c1), recovery rate from asymptomatic class (\u03b3 a ) are the most influential parameter. The basic reproduction number calculated from actual data lies between 1.99 and 2.10. The study of the effective basic reproduction number shows that it declines from 6.91 to 1.995. Our findings show that the outbreak size and peak prevalence can be reduced from 100 to 13% and from 37.77 to 0.28%, respectively, by increasing the proportion of the people who maintain the safe distance from each other (d) by 0.77. The findings show that increasing the proportion of asymptomatic infected population detected and isolated ( p) by at least 72% the total outbreak size will be reduced from 94.65% to nearly 2.772%, whereas the peak prevalence reduces by 18%.",
