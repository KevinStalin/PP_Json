The mother had no contact history with suspected and infected patients. She also had no fever, cough, dyspnea or gastrointestinal symptoms. But she lived in areas with a high prevalence of COVID-19,and blood tests revealed a normal range for the mother A term male newborn was born by caesarean section on April 11th, 2020 with a birth weight of 4300, a height of 47 cm and a head circumference of 35 cm. Furthermore, Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes after birth, respectively. Additionally, vital signs were: temperature (36.7 \u00b0C), blood pressure (67/39 mm Hg), heart rate (156 beats per minute [bpm]), respiratory rate (72 breaths per minute), oxygen saturation (90%), cyanosis, tachypnea, intercostal and subcostal retractions, grunting and the clinical respiratory score (5-6). Immediately, the newborn was transferred from another hospital to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) ward of Shahid Akbar-Abadi Hospital in Tehran (Iran) due to progressive respiratory distress during the first 4 hours after birth. Furthermore, the neonate had no contact with the mother after birth. There was also no skin-to-skin contact after birth due to respiratory distress, and breastfeeding was not performed by the mother.",

Also, the neonate was treated with ampicillin (50mg/kg /TDS for 24 hours) and amikacin (10mg/kg every 12 h for 24 hours).

Unfortunately, these specimens were not collected for PCR due to a lack of access to the maternal umbilical cord and amniotic fluid. After 24 h, the RT-PCR test results of the neonate and the mother were positive for COVID-19. chest radiography in the early hours after birth demonstrated bilateral scattered opacities preferably in the middle lobe of the right lung (Fig 1) . On examination, the patient had normal echocardiography. Regarding the imaging evidence and the persistence of respiratory distress of newborn, the antibiotics were changed to meropenem (20 mg/kg/TDS) and vancomycin (15 mg/kg/BD) on the second day of birth.",
