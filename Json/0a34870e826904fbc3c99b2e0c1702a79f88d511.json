The termination of the universal BCG vaccination program in Sweden had dramatic effects on the BCG coverage rate. Based on nationwide reports on the vaccination status of children below 7 sent to the National Bacteriological Laboratory in 1981, 92% of children born in 1974 got vaccinated, against 26% of those born in 1975, and less than 2% of those born between 1976 and 1980 11 . Among children born in 1975, most of the vaccinated children were born in the first quarter of the year, when the universal vaccination policy was still in place", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "15 years of age in 1986, four years before the 1975 cohort turned 15 years old. Finally, Sweden stopped its vaccination program for conscripts in 1979, long before the 1975 cohort would do its military service18 . Overall, children born before April 1st 1975 benefited from a BCG vaccination policy at birth, while children born after that did not benefit from any BCG vaccination policy.This being said, there is a number of limitations to this work that one has to bear in mind. As in many other countries, Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten's cases count probably underestimates the true number of cases, because it only includes cases confirmed by a laboratory test. Its deaths count probably underestimates the true number of COVID-19 deaths as well, as it only includes deaths where a COVID-19 diagnosis has been confirmed during the past 30 days. However, these limitations are common to all studies on this question and are unlikely to affect much the results.Furthermore, RD estimates only apply to units close to the eligibility threshold. For instance, this study estimates the effect of universal BCG vaccination for individuals born around April 1st 1975, who are in their mid-forties during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though some of the BCG protective effects tend to fade rather than increase over time 19 , it could still be the case that BCG vaccination at birth has larger effects against COVID-19 on older than middle-aged individuals. When it generalized BCG vaccination in the 1940s, Sweden simultaneously started vaccinating various age groups: newborns in 1943, children entering and leaving school in 1944, and military conscripts in 1945 20 . BCG vaccination rates are not available for cohorts born in the 1930s and 1940s, but it seems likely that the vaccination rate increased gradually, so BCG introduction in Sweden does not lend itself to an RD analysis. There may be other countries where BCG adoption policies in the 1940s and 1950s have created discontinuous changes in the vaccination rate of consecutive cohorts.
