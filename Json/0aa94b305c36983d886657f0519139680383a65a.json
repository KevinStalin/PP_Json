Here we report the identification of the hexosamine D-mannosamine (ManN) as an EC mitogen and survival factor for bovine and human microvascular EC, with an additivity with VEGF. ManN inhibits glycosylation in ECs and induces significant changes in N-glycan and Oglycan profiles. We further demonstrate that ManN and two N-glycosylation inhibitors stimulate EC proliferation via both JNK activation and the unfolded protein response caused by ER stress. ManN results in enhanced angiogenesis in a mouse skin injury model. ManN also promotes angiogenesis in a mouse hindlimb ischemia model, with accelerated limb blood flow recovery compared to controls. In addition, intraocular injection of ManN induces retinal neovascularization. Therefore, activation of stress pathways following inhibition of protein glycosylation can promote EC proliferation and angiogenesis and may represent a therapeutic strategy for treatment of ischemic disorders. 1 1234567890():,;",

Metabolic switches in ECs, such as fatty acid, glucose, and glutamine metabolism, have been reported to trigger angiogenesis 7, 8 . ECs in the tumor vasculature are known to rely on glycolysis for ATP production, for instance through enhanced expression of glucose transporter GLUT1. Lowering glycolysis in tumor ECs arrests their proliferation 9 . In addition, aberrant glycosylation patterns have been documented during oncogenic transformation and progression of cancer and it has been proposed that inhibiting glycosylation may result in suppression of key angiogenesis pathways, including VEGF/VEGFR2 and Notch 10 . Evidence that has emerged in recent years points to glycans as novel angiogenesis regulators due to changes in protein glycosylation 11 . For example, the glycan-binding protein Galectin1 has been reported to interact with VEGFR2, leading to ligand-independent receptor activation, which may contribute to tumor resistance to anti-VEGF therapy 11 . Therefore, EC metabolism has been identified as a new target for antiangiogenic therapy, particularly through inhibition of energy metabolism and glycosylation.",

We focused our analysis on one of these, ManN, a hexosamine originally identified as a component of bacterial cell wall 15 because it showed the most potent and consistent effects. ManN had significant stimulatory effects in the 5-500 \u03bcM dose range and was also additive with VEGF in promoting BCEC proliferation. Dose-dependent effects of ManN on BCEC proliferation, in the absence or in the presence of VEGF, are shown in Fig. 1a , b. A maximal~6.5-fold increase in EC-covered surface by ManN at 50 \u03bcM alone (Fig. 1a) or~2.5-3fold increase in fluorescence units upon AlamarBlue\u00ae addition (Fig. 1b) was obtained when cells were treated with 50 \u03bcM ManN and 5 ng/ml VEGF, compared to VEGF alone. AlamarBlue\u00ae detects mitochondria activity as an indication of cell viability which correlates with cell number at certain ranges 16 . The effects of ManN had a bell-shaped dose-response curve, with inhibition at higher concentrations (Fig. 1a, b) . Additive effects of ManN in promoting BCEC proliferation were observed also with bFGF ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ) and in bovine retinal EC (BRECs) (Fig. 1c) . As expected, the effects of ManN on BCEC proliferation were dependent on cellular glycolysis. The additivity between ManN and VEGF was abolished when glucose-free media was used. On the other hand, the activity of VEGF was not dependent on the glycolysis pathway ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) . However, there was a significant cytotoxicity with as little as 4 \u03bcM ManN, even in the presence of VEGF, in glucose-free media.",

We examined whether ManN and/or VEGF could activate major signal transduction pathways known to promote proliferation, such as ERK, AKT, mTOR, and CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) in BCECs. ManN activated ERK, AKT, mTOR, and CREB at 40 \u03bcM. Stimulation of ERK, AKT, and CREB was rapid and occurred within 10-30 min after adding ManN (Fig. 2a, b, c) . Furthermore, we observed an enhancement in activation of ERK, AKT, and CREB when both ManN and VEGF were present compared to ManN or VEGF alone (Fig. 2a, b) . We also explored whether ManN could activate the ACC (Acetyl-CoA carboxylase)/eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase 3) pathway. Activation of the energy sensor AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) leads to eNOS activation and NO (nitric oxide) production; the latter exerts bellshaped effects on EC proliferation 21 . Both eNOS and ACC were significantly activated by 40 \u03bcM ManN within 10-30 min (Fig. 2c) . However, activation of ERK, AKT, mTOR, CREB, ACC, and eNOS was not unique to ManN. Indeed, other hexosamines such as ManNAc and mannose induced a similar activation of these signal transduction pathways (Fig. 2c ). While activation of these common proliferation pathways likely contributed, we hypothesized that some unique mechanism(s) may be implicated in the EC mitogenic effects of ManN.",

Western blot analysis revealed that, among three MAPK family members (ERK, p38, JNK), JNK was specifically activated by ManN. When growing BCECs were switched to proliferation assay media without growth factors, JNK and its downstream c-Jun were significantly activated by ManN in a dose-dependent manner, but not by mannose (Fig. 3a, b) . Treatment of BCECs with the JNK specific inhibitor SP600125 (5 \u03bcM) abolished the effects of ManN on BCEC proliferation (Fig. 3c ). Next, we tested the effects of ManN on BCECs following transfection with siRNA against JNKs (namely JNK1 and JNK2, as JNK3 is not expressed in BCECs). Knocking down~80% of either JNK1 and/or JNK2 by two independent siRNAs against JNK1 or JNK2 abolished mitogenic effects of ManN on BCECs at \u03bcM concentrations (Fig. 3d, Fig. 7b ) and hRMVECs (Supplementary Fig. 7c) .

New lower molecular weight bands (~170-200 kDa) appeared in BCECs treated with ManN in a dose-dependent manner, compared to the control (a major band at~230 kDa and a minor band at~210 kDa) (Figs. 4b, c, e, 5a, b; Supplementary Figs. 4b, 5a, 7a, 8a). This shift was unique to ManN among hexosamines and their derivatives (Fig. 4a) . VEGF alone had no effect on molecular mass. Adding VEGF to ManN caused no additional shifts ( Fig. 4a; Supplementary Fig. 6a ). Lower molecular weight VEGFR2 bands are not likely degradation products since ManN removal completely reverse the effects of ManN on molecular mass after 24 h (Fig. 4e) . However, based on PNGase F treatment, it appears that not all the glycosylation on VEGFR2 was abolished by ManN, at least at \u03bcM concentrations ( Supplementary  Fig. 7d ). Experiments with the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor axitinib, a potent VEGFR2 inhibitor 6 , illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 5a , b, indicate that decreases in VEGFR2 molecular mass and stimulation of BCEC proliferation by ManN are not dependent on VEGFR2 signaling. A significant change in VEGFR2 protein mass was also observed in hRMVEC ( Supplementary Fig. 7c ), HUVEC (Fig. 4f) , and hDMVECs ( Fig. 4g ) with 40 \u03bcM ManN, whereas the additive effect of ManN and VEGF on proliferation of these cells occurred at mM levels ( Supplementary Fig. 3a , b, e, f).",

This enzyme has been used to screen for potential N-glycosylation inhibitors 23 . ManN, but not other hexosamines or their derivatives, showed inhibitory activity at 400 \u03bcM ( Supplementary Fig. 9a ), which is considerably higher than the effective mitogenic concentrations in BCECs. No effect of ManN up to 2 mM on \u03b1or \u03b2-glucosidases was detected ( Supplementary Fig. 9b, c) . N-linked glycans from BCECs were isolated by enzymatic cleavage, followed by purification and characterization using MALDI-TOF-MS. Treatment with 40 \u03bcM ManN resulted in a significant time-dependent reduction in Man6GlcNAc2 (Man-6), Man-8, and Man-9 in total oligomannose N-glycan content compared to the untreated control, whereas a significant early phase accumulation of Man-5 and Man-7 was observed after ManN treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 9d ). ManN has been previously shown to inhibit lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) synthesis, to change protein GPI biosynthesis and hybrid glycan production as well as to incorporate into the glycans in MDCK cells 24 . It remains to be determined whether reduction in Man-9 was partly due to LLO inhibition. Accumulation of Man-5 over time suggested that inhibition of mannosidase is unlikely the mechanism of pro-angiogenic activity in BCECs.",

After N-linked oligosaccharides are transferred to nascent proteins by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase), ER-resident glucosidases, and mannosidases generate a series of glycan-trimming intermediates that are specifically recognized by ER-localized lectins to direct the nascent proteins into protein folding, degradation, or export pathways. One of the consequences of inhibition of protein glycosylation is compromised protein folding, leading to ER stress 26, 27 . The physiological responses to the UPR are mediated by changes in gene expression, such as the regulation of ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP (also called glucose-regulated protein 78, binding of immunoglobulin protein) and another multifunctional transcription factor CHOP (CCAATenhancer-binding protein homologous protein) 28, 29 . Impaired UPR function, for instance during aging, creates a permissive environment for protein aggregation, unresolved ER stress, and chronic inflammation 30 .",

Both were previously shown to mitigate Tunicamycin-induced PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP arm of UPR and Bip expression. We found that 2 mM 4-PBA, but not 500 \u03bcM TUDCA, could prevent the induction of CHOP expression by ManN at 400 \u03bcM and 5 mM and restore the expression of ATF-6 (Activating Transcription Factor-6) by ManN at 400 \u03bcM (Fig. 5c) . Likewise, restoration of ATF-6 expression was much weaker by TUDCA compared to 4-PBA. As a transmembrane ER glycoprotein, ATF-6 is cleaved liberating a 50 kDa amino-terminal fragment that translocates to the nucleus which activates transcription of ER chaperones and ER-associated degradation components such as Bip and CHOP upon accumulation of improperly folded proteins in the ER 28 . Pre-treating cells with 1 mM 4-PBA for 4 h could effectively reverse the bell-shaped activity of ManN on BCEC proliferation in the absence or presence of VEGF.

These include NIH3T3 fibroblasts and AML12 liver cells (mouse), ARPE-19 RPE cells (human), and freshly isolated bovine pituitary cells. We also tested several human cell types related to our in vivo models such as dermal fibroblasts and keratinocytes. In addition, we screened four human or mouse cancer cell lines (A673, U87MG, Calu6, and 4T1) (Fig. 6 ). To examine post-translational modifications of proteins in non-ECs, we used bFGFR1 or \u03b21 integrin to monitor molecular mass change. Similar to BCECs, ManN not mannose could induce molecular mass change in all these non-ECs (Fig. 6 inserts). However, unlike BCECs ( ManN specifically activates the JNK pathway in BCECs. a BCECs grown in growth media (GM: low-glucose DMEM containing 10% bovine calf serum (BCS), 10 ng/ml VEGF and 5 ng/ml bFGF) were switched to growth factor-free media, followed by treatment with ManN or Mannose at 4 \u03bcM-4 mM. Four hours later, cell lysates were collected and subjected to western blot analysis for phosphorylated JNK (Thr 183/Tyr 185), p38 (Thr 180/Tyr 182), and ERK (Thr 202/Tyr 204), as well as total JNK, p38, and ERK. b ManN, but not mannose, could activate JNK and its downstream c-Jun. \u03b2-actin served as the loading control.

To establish whether the effects of ManN on endothelial cells in vitro translate in angiogenesis stimulation in vivo, we initially investigate ManN effects in a splinted wound model in mice. In this model, the repair process is entirely dependent on epithelialization, cellular proliferation, and angiogenesis, which closely mirror the biological processes of human wound healing 38 . We tested the effects of ManN and VEGF, alone or in combination. Topical applications of 20 \u03bcg of VEGF or 20 \u03bcg of ManN daily was done for the first 3 days after wounding. When VEGF and ManN were combined, a significant acceleration of wound closure was observed during the early phase of healing (Fig. 8a ). Compared with VEGF or ManN monotherapy, the combination had a significant faster wound closure starting from day 2 ( Fig. 8b and Supplementary Fig. 11a ). On day 4, an average closure of the wound was 81.5%, 75.6%, 66.9%, and 29.8% in PBS-, ManN-, VEGF-, and combinationtreated group, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. 11a) . We quantified small vessel numbers around the wound area at day 4. A significant increase in CD31-positive vessels was found in the combination group compared to PBS control, VEGF, or ManN alone (Fig. 8c, d) .",

Since Kif has been previously administered intraperitoneally for in vivo studies 42 , we employed this route in our study. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) was used as a non-invasive method to monitor time and extent of the blood flow recovery in the ischemic limb 43 . Serial examination of blood flow was taken with LDPI and increment of the perfusion ratio of ischemic (ligated; left side) to nonischemic (sham; right side) hindlimbs after ligation was used to indicate a recovery of blood flow. Starting immediately after surgery, mice were orally fed with 20% ManN or 1 mg/ml Kif i.p. every other day, as described in \"Methods\". One week after surgery, the perfusion ratio in H 2 O-fed group indicated a blood flow recovery of~25%, a value that is in good agreement with published data with the same type of lesion, in the same strain of mice 40, 44 . However, the blood flow recovery in ManN and Kif-treated group was about 40% and 47%, respectively, which demonstrated an accelerated recovery rate of blood flow compared to H 2 O-treated mice ManN specifically induces expression of unfolded protein response (UPR) responsive proteins. a BCECs were cultured in growth media (GM) until~80% confluency. Media were changed to growth factor-free media containing 10% BCS in the presence or absence of 40 or 400 \u03bcM of ManN or mannose for various times.

Cell lysates were separated on NuPAGE 3-8% Tris-Acetate gel for western blot analysis. c 4-PBA, but not TUDCA, could effectively block the induction of CHOP in BCECs, accompanied by a restoration of expression of transcription factor ATF-6 upon 400 \u03bcM ManN treatment.

Using this model, we investigated the effects of ManN in retinal neovascularization. We also tested Kif in this model because it is a water-soluble inhibitor and its mechanism of glycosylation inhibition is well-established 35 . In addition, it shares with ManN the ability to activate ERK, AKT, and stress pathways in BCEC (Fig. 7e) .",

We have been able to translate in vitro effects of ManN into efficacy in multiple in vivo models. To our knowledge, effects of ManN on ECs and angiogenesis have not been previously reported. We propose a link between changes in glycosylation patterns in mammalian ECs and angiogenesis by using well-known glycosylation inhibitors together with ManN. We also provide evidence that the effects of ManN on endothelial cells are independent on VEGFR2 activation. ManN was discovered in the 1960s as a bacterial wall component 15 , and accounts for 5-10% of capsular polysaccharides 45 . The related N-acetyl mannosamine is thought to be an intermediate in the biosynthesis of sialic acids 46 . Over the years, multiple effects of ManN on enzymes, growth factor-mediated signaling, protein stability, and cell viability were documented [47] [48] [49] [50] . Most of these effects were not unique to ManN and could be elicited by other hexosamines. In addition, they required high concentrations 45, 48 . ManN was reported to have antitumor properties 47 , to stimulate osteogenic differentiation 48, 51 , and to protect articular cartilage 49 . More recently, ManN was used as an intermediate in modifying various molecules/nanoparticles 52 and in the synthesis of non-natural ManNAc analogs for the expression of thiols on cell-surface sialic acids to facilitate high-throughput screening 53 . However, to date, no effects of ManN on ECs have been described.",

In addition, ManN was reported to change protein GPI biosynthesis and hybrid glycans production in the ER [54] [55] [56] . However, none of the angiogenic-related proteins we examined are GPI-anchored. The decrease in Man-9 found in our study could be a direct result of inhibiting LLO donor synthesis, i.e., Glc3Man9GlcNAc20PP-Dol formation, which is then transferred from the dolichol donor onto the polypeptide.

Glycosylation inhibition is thought to be a new pharmacological strategy targeting metabolic pathways essential for excessive angiogenesis in various pathological conditions, and glycosylation inhibitors are expected to have anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic properties 10,59,60 . Glycosylation has been recently shown to be important in cellular stress response and compensatory angiogenesis in response to VEGF-VEGFR2 signaling blockade 61 . Stress-induced O-GlcNAcylation was reported to promote survival in response to DNA damage, ER stress, glucose deprivation, and hypoxia in a variety of cell types 62 . In contrast, our study links glycosylation inhibition to angiogenesis promotion, and while it does not negate the above-mentioned studies, it raises the possibility that inhibiting glycosylation within the tumor microenvironment may, at least in some circumstances, result in stimulation rather than suppression of tumor angiogenesis. Angiogenesis has the potential of providing a therapeutic benefit to patients with ischemic disorders such as peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or coronary ischemia 4 . This hypothesis led to a series of clinical trials in the past decades, testing angiogenic factors such as VEGF-A, VEGF-C, bFGF, or HGF, delivered by gene therapy or as recombinant proteins. Unfortunately, none of these studies was successful, in spite of promising preclinical studies 5 . Indeed, achieving clinical success may be contingent not only on a better understanding of EC biology but also on identifying novel molecular tools and/or approaches 63 . A renewed interest in these efforts is exemplified by recent trials with a modified RNA encoding VEGF-A in patients with type 2 diabetes 64 .",

Currently, we are testing the hypothesis that combinations of ManN, or other glycosylation inhibitors, with VEGF-A, may have advantages over monotherapy for the treatment of ischemic disorders. The combination might be a promising avenue for PAD. The lack of direct permeability-enhancing effects of ManN may prove valuable, since it is expected to result in less edematous tissues. In this context, damage to lung endothelium is a central pathogenic event in the respiratory failure associated with a variety of infections, including SARS-CoV-2 65 . It is tempting to speculate that an endothelial cell mitogen like ManN, devoid of permeabilizing effects, may help protect and stabilize blood vessels and thus limit tissue damage.",

Finally, the Oglycan was purified by passing over C18 cartridge. Dried and purified O-glycan was then methylated and used for O-glycan analysis after permethylation. Permethylated samples were then dissolved in absolute methanol and mixed with SDHB (Super-DHB) MALDI matrix in 1:1 v/v ratio and spotted on maldi plate. Mass spectral data were acquired using Bruker AutoFlex mass spectrometer at positive, reflectron mode. The mass spectral data were analyzed and annotated using GlycoWork Bench software and masses matched with the proposed structures were annotated.

Statistical inference was based on the p-value of each comparison using R function \"wilcox.test\". We used linear mixed-effects (LME) model to investigate the wound area (in percentage), between three treatment groups (ManN, VEGF, VEGF + ManN) and PBS group. Two LME models were fitted. In the first LME model, the controlled group was considered as the reference group. We included day effect (considered days as categorical variable instead of continuous variable), and its interaction with treatment as fixed effects, and we included subject id as the random effect to involve correlations among measurements on different days for the same subject. There's no difference among different groups at baseline. In the second LME model, we relevel group VEGF + ManN as the reference group in order to investigate comparisons between singletreatment groups and combination treatment. For each LME model, we explored different treatment effects and their corresponding p values on day 3, day 5, and day 8 with respect to the reference group, respectively.
