Methods A multidisciplinary team formulated and implemented consensus guidelines using the Plan-Do-Study-Act method of quality improvement. Outcome measure was rate of compliance to guidelines, process measure was age of starting PNS treatment, and balancing measure was rate of repeat steroid courses. Results Retrospective application of guidelines to preceding 10 months showed mean baseline compliance rate of 71% (n = 42). After implementation, compliance escalated to a mean rate of 96% within 6 months. Rate of PNS treatment \u2264 30 days of life increased from 50 to 80%, while rate of repeat PNS was unchanged. Conclusions Compliance with new guidelines for PNS treatment of BPD was quickly attained using simple quality improvement interventions. Further study is needed to evaluate effects of these guidelines on clinical outcomes.",

Postnatal steroids (PNS) are powerful antiinflammatory agents that can be helpful in improving lung function, facilitating extubation, and reducing the burden of BPD [4, 5] . While routine use of PNS is not recommended because of its adverse effects on the developing brain, using PNS selectively in premature infants at high risk for developing BPD has been shown to decrease the risk of BPD without adversely affecting neurodevelopment [6] [7] [8] . Translating this selective strategy to clinical practice, however, is challenging and the lack of evidence-based guidelines has led to wide variation in clinical practice [9] .",

A selective strategy of PNS treatment was adopted, but recommendations on which infants qualified as high risk for PNS treatment were lacking. With over 30 neonatal faculty members of differing training backgrounds, this lack of guidance led to wide practice variation in timing of treatment and severity of lung disease used for patient selection. The lack of guidelines also contributed to dissatisfaction amongst the care teams and made it challenging to understand the impact of steroid treatment on clinical outcomes. To address these concerns, a multidisciplinary team was assembled to develop guidelines for patient selection and timing of initial PNS treatment for high-risk infants with developing BPD, and implement these guidelines using quality improvement (QI) methodology. The smart aim of the project was to achieve adherence to local clinical practice guidelines on the use of PNS in preterm infants for BPD above 90% within a 6-month period.",

In infants at high risk of developing BPD, treatment with PNS may be beneficial in decreasing lung disease; however, the lack of guidelines contributes to wide variation in clinical practice. As consistent processes and decreased variation have been shown to improve clinical outcomes [16, 17] , we assembled a multidisciplinary team to synthesize and implement consensus guidelines for identification and timely treatment with PNS of preterm infants at highest risk for BPD. Using the PDSA method of QI, we successfully increased adherence to our local guideline recommendations from 71% to 96% within 6 months. In doing so, we reduced variability in practice and increased timely treatment of high-risk infants. Notably, our interventions did not lead to an increase in rate of repeat PNS treatment indicating that the guidelines were not associated with increased steroid exposure.",

            "text": "Several questions remain unanswered regarding best practices for PNS treatment of preterm infants for BPD prevention or treatment [4, 18] . In crafting our local guidelines, we reviewed best-available evidence from published studies as well as input from our own local data. We adopted the selective strategy of treating only infants at high risk for BPD as first described by Doyle et al. [7] and subsequently recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [6] . However, instead of using mechanical ventilation status at 7 or 14 days per AAP as a surrogate marker of high BPD risk, we used the online BPD risk calculator developed by the NICHD [11] . We defined high-risk infants as those with combined risk of severe BPD or death \u226535% based on our previous study that identified this cut-off as most predictive of our local practice of PNS treatment. We also adopted a strategy of earlier treatment based on studies from the NICHD Neonatal Research Network suggesting that delayed PNS treatment was associated with worse clinical outcomes. One study by Wilson-Costello et al. [19] showed that PNS treatment after 33 weeks' PMA was associated with greatest odds for death or neurodevelopmental impairment. Another study by Harmon et al. [20] showed higher odds of severe BPD among infants treated with PNS \u2265 50 days of life. Our own local data also suggested an association between PNS treatment after 28 days of life and worse outcomes, including longer days on mechanical ventilation and longer length of hospital stay [13] . Initial buy-in from neonatal faculty through education and the consensus guidelines was high but inadequate in enacting a consistent change in clinical practice. To ramp up the project, a just-in-time email reminder system was implemented, which facilitated recall and increased compliance. Long-term feasibility was challenging, however, because the system was labor-intensive and dependent on one neonatal fellow tracking infants who met guidelines and sending the just-in-time emails [21, 22] . Realizing the value of regular discussions regarding PNS treatment for maintaining compliance, our team solicited the assistance of the small-baby team to formally review infants for their eligibility for PNS treatment at their bimonthly team meetings. Initial results from this latest intervention have been positive.",
