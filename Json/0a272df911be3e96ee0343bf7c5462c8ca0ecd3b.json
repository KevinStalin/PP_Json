A total of 50 COVID-19 patient samples were correctly diagnosed with 100% accuracy (relative fluorescence ratios: N gene 95% CI 23.2-36.3, ORF1ab gene 95% CI 27.6-45.4). All controls, including RNase P, showed expected findings. Overall ratios were robustly distinct between positive and negative cases relative to the pre-established 5-fold change in fluorescence read output. We have evaluated the accuracy of detecting conserved targets of SARS-CoV-2 across a range of viral loads using the SHERLOCK CRISPR collateral detection reaction in a clinical setting.

The gold standard test uses quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach. RT-PCR based approaches for SARS-CoV-2 typically require detection of multiple targets. For this, several pre-requisites need to be in place such as having hydrolysis sequence-specific probes that need to be labeled with a distinct fluorescent dye and an appropriate quencher moiety. The emission maxima of the dyes must not overlap with each other and reactions need to be carried out on an appropriate real-time cycler that supports multiplex analysis. Further, for downstream quantification, standard curves are necessary for analysis and the efficiency of the method may vary between family (i.e. Cas12, Cas13) that are engineered with a programmable spacer sequence and nucleotide binding domains that can cleave the nucleic acid target of interest 7, 8 .",

The current approach naturally leverages SHERLOCK as a CRISPR-based diagnostic platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA.

Of note, a limit of detection of 12 copies/\u00b5L and a 45 minute run time has been reported for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection using the Cas12 system 17 . This assay, termed DETECTR was given EUA status, and examines the N2 portion of the N gene. The Sherlock CRISPR SARS-CoV-2 kit corroborates these findings and expands the repertoire of viral genomic analyses to the Cas13 CRISPR-Cas effector family using fluorescence-based detection. By contrast to the DETECTR assay, the SHERLOCK approach used in the current study examined two SARS-CoV-2 gene targets (N and ORF1ab).

The second step initiates transcription of the DNA and activates collateral cleavage activity of CRISPR complex programmed to the target RNA sequence (i.e. programmable crRNA) 11 . As Cas13 cleaves the reporter RNA molecules, separating the two ends, a fluorescent signal is detected on a standard plate reader (Figure 3) . SHERLOCK technology was designed to detect fragments of the N and the O genes of SARS-CoV-2. A third target, the human RP gene, acted as an internal extraction control.

A similar pattern is shown in the bottom two panels where the ORF1ab target is not detected (panel c) versus detected (panel d). Of note, the Y-axis values are an order of magnitude higher between the two scenarios (e.g. detected/not detected) due to the collateral activity of the CRISPR Cas13 guide RNAs to cleave and release fluorescence in the presence of SARS-CoV-2.",
