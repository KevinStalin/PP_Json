The Green Credit Policy (GCP) in China for manufacturing, as a part of a sustainable finance package, initiatives restrictions with suppliers to reduce harmful pollution for the environment. The study mainly validates the impact of GCP on manufacturing for diminishing the emerged pollution to the environment. The study develops Neutrosophic Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making Framework (N-MCDMF) according to neutrosophic theory and various MCDM methods of grey relational analysis (GRA), analytic network process (ANP), the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory technique (DEMATEL), and the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to support the decisionmakers with highly systematic procedures in the uncertain and inconsistent environmental conditions. The N-MCDMF evaluates the conditions of GCP and recommends the optimal Supply Chain Management (SCM) in manufacturing alternatives. A case study is presented for the validation of the issues of applicability and flexibility for the proposed N-MCDMF. The results obtained from the implementation of the N-MCDMF indicates the applicability and flexibility of the proposed approach. In addition, results show that SCM in manufacturing can provide more cooperation for the environment to reduce harmful pollution and to attain sustainability for achieving motivations under the restrictions of GCP.",

In MCDM, the experts may provide confusing perspectives because of the real-life environmental conditions of vague, impression, inconsistency, and uncertainty . Hence, the MCDM should be extended with advanced mathematical sets to handle the current environmental challenges. Consequently, the Fuzzy set is used to deal with vague or imprecise of MCDM . Traditionally, the Fuzzy set used the membership function to find preference relations, however, there are technical difficulties to create membership functions that reflect all problem's aspects in real situations of indeterminate cases (Abdel-basset and Mohamed.

The model of MCDM presents the DEMATEL method to analyze and examine the relationships and strengths among evaluation criteria by using a questionnaire. To determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria, the study applied a hybrid model of DEMATEL and ANP technique.

The N-MCDMF integrates various MCDM techniques such as GRA, DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS with auspices of neutrosophic theory to achieve the optimal recommended solutions. In Fig.1 , an abstraction for the N-MCDMF is modeled such that the four major parts for the research are modeled as follows: 1) Identify study objectives, 2) Collect and integrate expert's knowledge in the proper format, 3) Evaluate the criteria of GCP, 4) Recommend optimal alternatives of SCM. First, the study objectives include the collecting and integrating of decision maker's judgments, criteria, and alternatives. The study objectives identify the main criteria and alternatives for the study. Second, the decision maker's judgments and experiences are included in the study in the form of a neutrosophic triangular scale that adopted true, indeterminate, and false cases of decisions. Third, for the N-MCDMF criteria, the GRA is an essential statistical analysis method that could evaluate multiple objective functions and detect the optimum objects with various performance attributes (Bademlioglu et al., 2020) . The GRA relies on the similarities among alternatives, the closet distances between alternatives and optimal solution refers to the degree of correlation . The DEMATEL mainly developed to scientific and human issues of complex and interrelated problems to achieve better comprehension for real-life situations . The DEMATEL formulate problems into comprehensive relationships among the problem's criteria to achieve to most proper solutions. The ANP method is a general form that uses comparison matrices for MCDM problems to evaluate the influence of the indicated calculated weights and priorities between criteria (Adel-Basset and Mohamed, 2019). Fourth, for the N-MCDMF alternatives, the TOPSIS depends on detecting the positive and negative candidate of solutions and recommending optimal solutions by computing relative closeness between the two groups . The MCDM as a popular methodology aids decision-makers to evaluate and achieve the ideal candidate of solutions Step 1: Detect the study objectives, alternatives, and criteria. The expert's perspectives and judgments are gathered surveys by the aid of reviews, vis-a-vis meetings of advices, and questioner to formulate in an appropriate form, more details in Appendix A.",

As a result, the case study is covered the current issues for GCP in chine as considering the following factored criteria: Management Authority, Anthropogenic Pollutants, Ingredients, Energy Efficiency, Water Efficiency, Modernization, Waste and pollution environment, and Epidemic diseases. The evaluation of GCP is confined into nine main criteria as mentioned in table 1, and the rank of SCM alternatives is highlighted on five alternatives. The five alternatives are corresponding to SCM of software companies SCM 1: Oracle, SCM 2 : SAP, SCM 3 : Copa Software, SCM 4: Manhattan Associates. SCM 5 : JDA. The problem formulation for criteria and alternatives has been detected from the perspectives of expertise in GCP, production experts, sales managers, quality control managers, and manufacturing managers. The N-MCDMF is used the hybrid MCDM methods of GRA, DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS to recommend optimal ranked alternatives to meet the evaluated GCP criteria.

The neutrosophic theory depends on three membership functions of true, indeterminate, and false respectively. The use of the MCDM method is a variant according to the problem definition. Consequently, the study combined GRA to evaluate the degree of interrelation among the criterion of GCP, DEMATEL to analyze the preferences among the criterion of GCP, ANP to obtain the final weights for the GCP criterion, to attain optimal SCM in manufacturing solution with the integration of neutrosophic theory to evaluate the conditions of GCP and recommends the optimal SCM in manufacturing alternatives applied the data model quality function to validate the framework.

In addition, the proposed N-MCDMF not only evaluates GCP but also recommends the best SCM in manufacturing. The N-MCDMF takes the advantages of many MCDM methods GRA, DEMATEL, ANP, and TOPSIS under the umbrella of the neutrosophic theory which makes a strengthening point of the study. For example, nowadays N-MCDMF can be used in many real problems. For example, the epidemic disease of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), countries can use the N-MCDMF to recommend the most optimum health care for the audience that applies the safety conditions criteria. The application of N-MCDMF can provide suitable accommodation of alternatives according to the decision maker's judgments to reach an optimum decision. Therefore, the N-MCDMF is a general, practical, and fixable approach in the real-world environmental condition, in addition to the ease of implementation in many applications",

While after changing the decision judgments and fixing decision alternatives, the results showed to be criteria in importance are mentioned as follows: I 3 , Ed 9 , M 6 , E 4 , Ma 1 , W 5 , H 7 , A 2 . While alternatives mentioned as follows SCM 1 , SCM 4 , SCM 2 , SCM 5 , SCM 3 . Therefore N-MCDM recommends SCM alternative's SCM 1 , SCM 2 , SCM 4 , but N-MCDM does not advise decisionmaker to deal with SCM alternative's SCM 3 in all circumstances. In general, the NMCDMF is proved to be applicable and flexible in different circumstances. The future work includes analyze the SCM especially stainable circular supplier selection and use J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f evolutionary algorithms to rate the weight of decision judgments. The future work includes make a detailed analysis of GCP conditions using evolutionary algorithms and including more countries around the world to study the effectiveness of GCP for humanity. ",
