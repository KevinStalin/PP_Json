Methods: This effect is studied using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model. We estimate the infection rate using a least square method with Poisson noise and calculate the reproduction number. Results: The infection rate is estimated to be 0.270 and the reproduction number to be 2.70. The approximate peak of the epidemic will be August 9, 2020. A 25% drop in infection rate will delay the peak by 11 d for a 1-mo intervention period. The total infected individuals in India will be 9% of the total population. Conclusions: The predictions are sensitive to changes in the behavior of people and their practice of social distancing.",

The objective of this study is to not only model the epidemic to study its effect but to also guide those involved in formulating policy and building health-care capacity. This disease has demonstrated person-to-person transmission, 3 and as India is a densely populated country, it is necessary to understand the effects of this disease to mitigate its risk. January 30, 2020, marked the first identified case of COVID-19 in India. 4 Meanwhile, COVID-19 has spread around the world. As of April 26, 2020, the United States of America has approximately 941 thousand confirmed cases, Spain has approximately 224 thousand confirmed cases, and Italy has approximately 195 thousand confirmed cases. India has approximately 27 thousand confirmed cases. 4 The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 5 The total number of confirmed cases in India and the daily increase in cases is depicted below in Figures 1 and 2 .",

The exposed population consists of individuals that are infected but not yet infectious and hence, introduces an incubation period for the virus in the model. Yang et al. in China and Kuniya in Japan use this model for the ongoing pandemic. 10, 11 The same methodology is adopted here.

This prediction is sensitive to changes in the behavior of not only the virus but of people and their practice of social distancing. India is still in the process of gearing up its health-care system, and it currently may be ill-equipped to deal with a large number of cases. Delaying the peak will ensure adequate medical equipment and personnel for all her citizens. It must be noted that, while a large reduction in infection rate or, \u03b2, is effective in delaying the peak, without continual intervention and efforts to reduce \u03b2, the total number of infected individuals does not change significantly. After a period of intervention, \u03b2 is assumed to go back to the originally calculated value. Therefore, intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size. In light of this, the WHO has issued multiple statements reiterating the importance of practicing social distancing. Additionally, proper hand hygiene, effective contact tracing and the use of face coverings are recommended. 5 This model is without vital dynamics that models births and natural deaths in a population in addition to the epidemic.",
