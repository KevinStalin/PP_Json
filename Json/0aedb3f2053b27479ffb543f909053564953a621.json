Pre-admission lipid lowering drugs prescription was associated with lower LDL-c, TC and Apo on admission (0.72 vs 1.33 mmol/L; p = 0.043, 2.46 vs 2.95 mmol/L; p = 0.049 and 0.55 vs 0.74 mmol/L; p = 0.037, respectively) and a trend for a higher in-hospital mortality (42.9% vs 12.5%, p = 0.110). Only 27 patients had a lipid , p = 0.003). Furthermore, in bivariate analysis including age and LDL-c level, LDL-c level was associated with 28-day mortality, whereas age was not (OR = 0.0233 [CI 95% 0.0006-0.8835], p = 0.0427 vs OR = 1.0291 [CI 95% 0.8794-1.2044], p = 0.7203, respectively). Our results suggest a role of lipid disorders in COVID-19 severity as proposed by Cao and colleagues (1). The decrease in TC could result from vasculopathy induced by SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, we observed a correlation between TC blood level and COVID-19 severity, assessed by PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Our series suggests that COVID-19 severity is linked with lipid level. It might be interesting to practice lipid dosage in broncho-alveolar lavage to assess if there is an intra alveolar lipid extravasation, alveolar obstruction and inflammation. Whether lipidlowering treatments (i.e., statins) could be associated with COVID-19 severity remains to be explored in larger studies. Experimental data suggest that statins have potential benefits in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including anti-inflammatory properties, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and antithrombotic effects. Nevertheless, clinical trials failed to show a benefit to statin administration in patients with ARDS (2). A possible explanation of failure of statins therapy in patients with ARDS could be partly explained by an increase in interleukin-18 level induced by statin therapy (3).
