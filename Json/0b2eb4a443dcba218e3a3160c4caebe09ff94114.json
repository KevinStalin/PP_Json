Genes in canonical PRR and IFN signaling pathways that are highly expressed in GCN at the basal level were determined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Yellow color indicates higher basal expression level in GCN compared to CN within cutoff values of a \u22652-fold change and an ANOVA P value with a Benjamini and Hochberg algorithm-corrected false discovery rate of 0.01. Fold differences in expression values between GCN and CN are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Unique molecular signatures associated with host defense responses (e.g., immune-related GTPases) in GCN also were determined by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. Shown are functional relationships that associate with antiviral activity, immune-related GTPases, and chemotaxis. Genes colored in blue show lower basal expression levels in GCN compared to CN. Supplementary Figure 5. Stat1 and Rsad2 are expressed differentially at the protein level in GCN and CN. Cells were left untreated or treated with 100 IU/mL of IFN-\u03b2 for 24 hours, and lysates were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 5% of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblot analysis was performed using antibodies against Stat1, \u03b2-actin, and Rsad2. Stat1 -/-GCN were used as a negative control for blotting of Stat1 protein. The results are representative of two independent experiments. Supplementary Figure 6. ISGs expression level is lower in Stat1 -/-GCN compared to wild-type GCN.RNA was harvested from Stat1 -/and wild-type GCN, and ISG expression levels were compared by qRT-PCR. The data is displayed as the \u2206Ct value compared to cellular levels of 18S ribosomal RNA. Differential ISG expression in distinct regions of the brain in na\u00efve mice.Differential gene expression of (a) Ifi27, (b) Irg1, and (c) Stat1 in the cerebellum and cortex of na\u00efve wild-type mice was determined by fluorescence in situ RNA hybridization. (d) Ubc, a housekeeping gene involved in cellular ubiqutination, was used as a positive control of staining. Dapb, a gene from E. coli, was used as a negative control (data not shown). Supplementary Figure 8. WNV infection of different neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum from brains of wild-type and Ifnar -/mice. Brains from wild type and Ifnar -/-C57BL/6 mice were harvested at day 6 (wild type) or day 4 (Ifnar -/-) after i.c. infection with 10 1 PFU of WNV. Viral titer was measured by plaque-forming assay on BHK21-15 cells. Solid lines represent the median viral titers and reflect data from six to ten mice per genotype. Supplementary Figure 9. Infection of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum from brains of fatal human WNV cases. Brain sections from seven fatal human cases of WNV encephalitis were stained with rat anti-WNV antisera (brown) or pre-immune sera. Infected CN and Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum are indicated by white arrows and black arrow heads, respectively. Insets are high-power images of each case.
