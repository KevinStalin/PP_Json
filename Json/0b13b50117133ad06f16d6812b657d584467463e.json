            "text": "CAP is one of the most common reasons for hospitalization in the US. It can affect individuals of any age and cause significant strain on the healthcare system due to its financial burden; but more importantly, it carries significant morbidity and mortality. Most of the mortality occurs in patients that require hospitalization. multiple components about CAP, such as the incidence, epidemiology, and outcomes of patients, can help us guide preventative measures and treatments. [1] The rationale behind this literature review, in addition to what was stated prior, is to point out the benefits of adequate risk-stratification in guiding appropriate management, and some of the clinical benefits of using Procalcitonin as a biomarker for pneumonia. Procalcitonin has been shown to be a promising inflammatory biomarker, with the ability to monitor a patient's response to treatment. The literature seems to favor procalcitonin as being more effective than other inflammatory markers, such as CRP, in terms of guiding appropriate therapy. [2] However, procalcitonin can also be increased in noninfectious diseases, which stresses the importance of follow-up measurements, because procalcitonin levels will be gradually increase in patients with CAP during a follow-up. 9 With proper risk-stratification techniques, such as CURB and PSI, we can estimate the risk of mortality for patients. Therefore, riskstratification can help to triage the appropriate level of care a patient requires, and help to identify those that may have a higher morbidity and mortality from CAP. [3] The pathophysiologic processes of CAP in the human body are well-studied, and as a result we have developed many effective antimicrobial agents to eliminate infection. Empirical treatment is preferred in the management of CAP; however, this is not without risks, such as: allergies, antibiotic-resistance, and antibiotic-misuse. Physicians must be aware that CAP can have a viral etiology in 25% of cases, which may account for poor response to antibiotics or atypical features. [4] The prompt identification and recognition of a viral-CAP, especially during influenza season, can dramatically improve outcomes and reduce mortality. [4] ",

            "text": "CAP is the leading cause of infectious disease-related death in the US, with mortality occurring largely in patients who require hospitalizations. It accounts for 4.5 million outpatient and emergency room visits annually. It is the second most common cause of hospitalizations and the most common infectious cause of death. [5, 6] It is estimated that 1.5 million unique CAP hospitalizations occur each year. CAP is not a reportable infection in the United States; therefore, data regarding the burden of the disease is primarily obtained through clinical investigation. [1] The University of Louisville Pneumonia Study was a prospective population-based cohort study of all hospitalized adults with CAP who resided in Louisville, Kentucky between 2014-2016. The patients in the study were defined as having CAP when 3 criteria were met: (1) presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph and/or chest CT scan at time of hospitalization; (2) at least one of the following: (a) new cough or sputum production, (b) fever > 37.8\u00b0C, or hypothermia < 35.6\u00b0C, (c) changes in leukocyte count (leukocytosis > 11,000 cells/\u03bcL; left shift >10% band forms/mL; or leukopenia: <4000 cells/\u03bcL); and (3) no alternative diagnosis at time of hospital discharge that justified the presence of criteria 1 and 2. During the 2-year study period, a total of 8284 hospitalizations were due to CAP. [1] The study indicated the annual incidence of adult patients hospitalized with CAP in the city of Louisville is 634 per 100,000 adults, which translates to approximately 1.5 million adult hospitalizations in the US. [1] approximated 20% of US hospitals. [7] The reported incidence of annual hospitalizations in elderly adults per 100,000 population for the years 2007-2009 was 1507 for the age range 65-74, 2205 for 75-84 years of age, and 3951 for greater than 85 years of age. It is estimated that approximately 100,000 adults will die during their hospitalizations due to CAP. Approximately 1 of 10 patients hospitalized with CAP required a second hospitalization due to a new episode of CAP during the same study year. Efforts to advance adequate prevention strategies and treatment modalities are needed. [1] ",

[4] Immune cells release cytokines and local inflammatory mediators, which cause additional damage to the lung parenchyma. Systemic inflammation ensues, leading to secondary symptoms such as fevers, chills, and fatigue. Accumulation of white blood cells and fluid congestion results in pus in the parenchyma with subsequent decreased compliance of the alveoli. These changes increase the patient's work-of-breathing and, ultimately, worsens hypoxemia and tachypnea. [8] (Figure 1 ) Pneumonia can affect patients of all ages and across all spectrums of health. Clinical comorbidities that dampen the mucociliary clearance and cough reflex can increase the chances of acquiring CAP. Social habits such as smoking also put patients at increased risk. Medical conditions that increase the risk of aspiration are also of concern, such as esophageal disorders, alcoholism, and neuromuscular disorders. [4, 8, 9, 10] ",

            "text": "Several risk factors for CAP are commonly found in the developed and developing countries, including smoking tobacco, exposure to animals, and recent upper respiratory tract infections (URTI). Smoking is a well-known risk factor for CAP with the risk being much higher for ex-smokers. Passive smoking is not associated with an increased CAP risk in adults, but it is a known risk factor for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) among children. [3] Smoking significantly increases the risk of acquiring CAP among immunocompromised patients such as HIV. [3] Smoking also has a suppressive effect on the protective actions of airway muco-ciliary clearance mechanisms, and on the various components of the innate and adaptive immune systems of the hosts, as well as direct effects on microbial pathogens that promote their virulence. [8, 9, 10] Several comorbid factors are well documented in the literature to increase the risk of CAP. One of the most common is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). [8, 9, 11] In older individuals, asthma can be a significant risk factor for CAP. Inflammation, bronchial obstruction, and hyperresponsiveness associated with asthma favors microorganism colonization. The evidence regarding the effects of other respiratory diseases such as bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and tuberculosis is insufficient. There may be some association between the medications used for the respiratory diseases and the development of CAP, independent of the underlying respiratory illness. Some randomized controlled trials have shown an association between corticosteroids and the development of a lung infection as a side effect, especially in patients with COPD. [9] (Table 1) Furthermore, other comorbid conditions increasing the risk of developing CAP include congestive cardiac failure, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, hepatic, renal insufficiency, and malignancy. Interestingly, recent studies have identified several mechanisms, specifically the presence of certain gene polymorphisms which contribute to an increased susceptibility for development of CAP, as well as a worse disease outcome. [12] These include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding proteins of the immune system. For example, IL-6 174G/G has been reported to protect patients with pneumococcal CAP against the development of ARDS, septic shock, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, which results in lower mortality. [3] In addition, there is ongoing investigation of the role of SNPs in the genes encoding the surfactant proteins (SP) A, B, C, and D, which revealed associations with susceptibility for the development of CAP and susceptibility for a more severe disease course.

Notably, the incidence of CAP increases 5-fold with age from 8.4 per 1,000 in those aged 65-69 years to 48.5 per 1,000 in those at least 90 years old. Although age by itself is not associated with a worse prognosis in the elderly hospitalized with CAP, a fatal event after CAP is often more probable in persons over the age of 65 years. In a retrospective analysis of older patients with CAP, mortality during the first 30 days was 20.7% in the older and 11.9% in the younger group (p<0.001). Additional research has observed that individuals over the age of 65 years of age had a higher 1-year mortality rate after being hospitalized for CAP compared with case-matched controls. [13] They observed that nearly half of all elderly patients admitted for CAP died in the subsequent year, with most of the deaths occurring after hospital discharge. However, advanced age is not an independent risk factor for a poorer prognosis. [1, 14] Of note, male gender has been identified as having a greater incidence of CAP and a worse prognosis. [3] Males were more likely to be admitted to the ICU, and more likely to die, compared with their female counterparts. [13] It is not completely understood why this relationship exists, but there is literature suggesting that in both animal and human models women are less likely to develop sepsis secondary to CAP, and are, therefore, less likely to succumb to this infection. Cell-mediated immunity is depressed in males compared to females, and that the higher estradiol levels in females may offer enhanced protection. [1, 9, 15] ",

It is classified as an \"atypical pneumonia\" because it presents with different symptomatology, an interstitial pattern on x-ray and responds to different antibiotics than pneumonia caused by typical bacteria (e.g., S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus). However, a recent study found that radiographic and tomographic manifestations of LD are similar to those found in CAP from typical bacterial origins. [17] The study sheds new light on the common belief that LD presents with atypical radiographic features. They argue that the accumulated evidence that clinical features are of limited utility in identifying the offending pathogens, and that their results support the notion that LD has nothing \"atypical\" in its radiological manifestation. Furthermore, the study suggests that atypical pneumonia should only refer to lower respiratory tract infections caused by specific respiratory pathogens including C. psittaci (psittacosis), F. tularensis (tularemia), C. burnetii (Q fever), C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, or Legionella species regardless of the clinical or radiological manifestations. [17] LD most likely represents less than 4% of CAP. [8, 17] The diagnosis is difficult to make, given the fastidious nature of Legionella and the lack of culture sensitivity. However, the diagnosis can still be made by culture, serological investigation, or urinary antigen detection. [17] Haemophilus influenzae:",

During a bacterial infection, the CALC-1 gene is upregulated which results in the increased production of procalcitonin by innate immune cells such as macrophages. [2, 23] The increase in production of procalcitonin tends to occur in the liver, lung, and intestines. Procalcitonin is identifiable within 2-3 hours, with a peak at 6 hours. Procalcitonin seems to have an advantage over c-reactive protein (CRP) because of its earlier increase with infection onset. [2, 23] It also has a better negative predictive value, which has been observed in children with fever of unknown origin or adults in the ICU with sepsis. [2, 23] Procalcitonin can reduce antibiotic usage by reducing the duration of an antibiotic course. [23] It is important to note that persistent elevated procalcitonin levels may indicate a complicated course, but there is also the possibility that it could be falsely elevated. In contrast, persistent low levels of procalcitonin can be seen in localized infections (e.g., empyema, abscess). In bacterial CAP, a delay in the initiation of antibiotic therapy can be associated with an increased mortality. If a patient presents with an infiltrate on chest radiograph in the presence of acute respiratory symptoms and repetitively low procalcitonin levels, physicians should consider other diagnosis than bacterial pneumonia such as: viral pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, congestive heart failure, and others. In contrast, procalcitonin levels that are >0.25\u03bcg/L -0.5\u03bcg/L support the diagnosis of CAP. [2] ",

[5, 6] It can affect patients of all ages and across all spectrums of health, with most of the hospitalizations occurring in older patients. [8, 9] Clinical manifestations can range based on the etiology of CAP, but sputum production tends to be the most significant manifestation in typical pneumonia. [4] Recent studies have shown that Legionnaires disease can have similar radiographic and tomographic manifestations that are similar to those found in typical CAP, and the proper diagnosis of Legionnaires disease rests upon the laboratory-based diagnostic tests plus the clinical and radiological diagnosis of pneumonia. [17] The management of CAP tends to be empirical antibiotic treatment, which can present with risks. However, with proper risk-stratification techniques, such as CURB and PSI, we can better guide antibiotic treatment. [14, 16] We hope that through this literature review, we have spread awareness about the prevalence of CAP and the utility of risk stratification methods, using procalcitonin as a biomarker and the many considerations to be aware of in terms of antibiotic therapy initiation.
