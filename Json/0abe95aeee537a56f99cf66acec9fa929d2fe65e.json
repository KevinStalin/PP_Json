These measures were expected to decrease overburdening healthcare systems, enable severe cases to be treated successfully and reduce overall mortality (Arshed, Meo and Farooq, 2020) . The success of these measures is particularly critical in the case of COVID-19 due to the Countries have taken different steps to contain and delay the spread of the virus within their borders, with differing degrees of success. China, for example, appeared to have halted the exponential increase of confirmed cases of the virus by limiting the freedom of citizens to move around their cities, provinces, and the country (Ding, et al., 2020) . The Italian government, as of March 9th has implemented a similar strategy, placing much of the country in lockdown and preventing groups of people from congregating in public spaces, encouraging measures of social distancing homogeneously throughout the country (Chiara, et al., 2020) .",

The US, for example, waited more than two weeks after the first confirmed case within its borders to enact localized testing procedures (Courtemanche, Garuccio, Pinkston and Yelowitz, 2020) . The British government followed the instructions of its scientific advisors to delay the mass gatherings and the closure of schools, instead favoring a policy that looked akin to pursuing herd immunity, in which vulnerable groups are isolated, and healthier individuals are exposed to the virus to achieve large-scale immunity (Fine et al. 2011; Anderson, Heesterbeek, Klinkenberg, and Hollingsworth, 2020) . In addition, measures were taken to restrict public gatherings, international travelling, use of face masks and recommendations of social distance. If measures like these are adopted, experts suggest that the deaths caused by coronavirus would drop (Ferguson et al. 2020; . Despite the variation in the measures and the timing across countries, adherence and implementation of protective measures is dependent on institutional and behavioral factors. As Van Bavel et al, (2020) had argued, slowing the viral transmission during pandemics requires significant shifts in behavior and social context influence the extent and speed of behavioral change. The J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f purpose of this study is to assess the factors associated with these dramatic behavioral responses. Following recreancy theory, elements included in this assessment are trust in social institutions, perceived vulnerability to becoming infected by the virus and perceived self-efficacy in implementing the measures (Freudenberg, 1993) .",

Furthermore, they are not driven by a conceptual theoretical framework (Bish and Michie, 2010). Our study is unique in that it provides a test of these hypotheses in real time, after the WHO declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic, in a country where there is a conflict between the public health officials and central government recommendations. Thus, we contribute to the literature by investigating the factors associated with the adoption of preventive measures in real time in a country in which the federal government has been slow to take measures and health system have issued policies inconsistent with the federal government. In doing this, we rely on recreancy theory, which argues that confidence in the ability of social institutions and perceived vulnerability to the disease are central factors predicting the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f adoption of protective behaviors (Freudenburg, 2001; Sapp and Downing-Matibag, 2009 ).",

In our model the element of trust refers to the public's trust that social institutions will respond to social risks (Freudenberg, 1993) . Trust is central to the public's perception of the legitimacy of the actions of the social agencies that oversee implementing social policy designed to reduce risks. Trust in institutions is important for individuals because the former have more resources than do individuals (Freudenburg, 1993) . Therefore, if they function appropriately, they can help individuals achieve their goals (Khodyakov 2007) . Lack of trust in how agencies manage risk can amplify public health concerns and increase public hesitancy to adopt preventive and avoidant behaviors (McComas 2004; Slovic 2000) . Given that we do not know all the people engaged in the activities required in a pandemic crisis, we extend them a measure of trust that they are performing in a responsible and dependable manner until something disabuses us of this belief (Freudenburg,1993; Khodyakov 2007) .",

Recreancy is evident in the extent to which systems are perceived as failing or unable to do their jobs (Sapp and Downing-Matibag, 2009 ).

Trust and confidence in social institutions is important as it provides the basis for the legitimate exercise of state authority. The notion of legitimacy refers to whether governments are entitled to be obeyed (Robertson 1985) . The effective implementation of any public policy requires that state action be legitimate and so be accepted and acceptable (Shao and Hao, 2020) . Such legitimacy is reflected in the extent to which citizens tolerate the interventions of public organizations, accept these organizations' decisions and cooperate to achieve the goals (Rothstein 1998) . In social risk situations, such as epidemics, trust in the government to respond effectively, trust in health institutions to provide accurate information on prevention and treatment, and trust in the media to provide accurate information are important for the public to feel that their health interests will be attended to in the best manner possible (Shao and Hao, 2020) . Public organizations build their legitimacy when they demonstrate the values and norms that underlie or are associated with trust through their organizational and managerial practices (Gregory 1995; Levi 1998) .",

In Brazil, President Bolsonaro has given little J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f importance to taking measures to address the COVID-19 pandemic. He is one of the few world leaders who refused to recognize the threat constituted by the virus and even encouraged his followers to disobey social distancing recommendations (Aquino, et al; Ortega and Orsini, 2020) . For this reason, we distinguished between trust in the government's ability to fight outbreaks and trust in the hospitals' and health workers' ability. We expect that confidence in the Brazilian government will be negatively associated with adopting protective measures, while confidence in the hospitals' and health workers' will be positively associated with adopting protective measures. This expectation is the result of contradictory recommendations that were provided by the national government and the health sector.",

Given its role in society's information flow, the mass media is uniquely positioned to analyze and inform the population of serious hazards and risks (Cottle 1998; Garfin, Silver and Holman, 2020) . Thus, the media can potentially influence what the public regards as a health hazard and its assessment of how successful the government and public health institutions are in dealing with the threat (Mesch, Schwirian and Kolobov 2013) . Consequently, trust in the information provided by the media is viewed as an important influence on people's beliefs, attitudes and behavior. The acceptance of information depends on trusted sources transmitted by the media on the incidence, fatalities and coping measures depends on the extent to which we trust the quality of the information (Garfin, Silver and Holman, 2020) . Trusted media provides information to the public to promote appropriate health protective behavior and effective institutional responses. During the 2015 MERS J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pandemic, it was found that exposure to traditional media affected the adoption of recommended protective behaviors (Seo, 2019) .

Risk is the likelihood of a hazard causing harm to individuals, groups or society at a given time and place (Fitzpatrick and La Gory 2011) .

In turn, risk calculation leads to the development of strategies and procedures to manage or reduce those hazards. A central component of risk calculation is the perceived threat of disease (Kraut, Graff and McLean 2011) . People are likely to engage in disease prevention behaviors if they perceive that the pandemic's social risk is translated in a perception that they are highly susceptible to the disease and that the disease has severe consequences (Glanz, Rimer and Lewis 2002) . In addition, studies have found that perceptions of the risk of personal and family infection are associated with the willingness to engage in preventive behaviors including vaccination (Kraut, Graff and McLean 2011; Kumar et al. 2012 ).",

Confidence in social institutions is a central concept in the recreancy theory (Khodyakov, 2007; Freudenburg, 2001) . It reflects the public's belief that social institutions have the competency, knowledge and ability to manage a major public health crisis and the perception that the policies developed by these institutions are in the best interests of the population (Shao and Hao, 2020) . In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, the voice of the government and the voice of health institutions and the media were not consistent in the evaluation of the risk and the social policy and responses required (Freitas, Silva and Cidade, 2020) . As the correlation matrix and the regression model revealed, confidence in the government was negatively related to preventive behaviors, indicating that the more confident people were in the national government that rejected social distance measures, the less likely they were to adopt protective measures. In contrast, confidence in hospitals and health workers and the media were positively associated with the adoption of such behaviors. The differences in the role of confidence in social institutions on the adoption of protective behaviors apparently reflects the discrepancies and inconsistencies in the messages from the government and the messages from the media and health system.",

The theory posits a correlation between confidence in social institutions, perceived vulnerability and adoption of protective behaviors. As expected, vulnerability was correlated with both measures. Those who felt more vulnerable were more likely to adopt protective measures. In addition, we found a correlation between vulnerability and confidence in the government and hospitals and mass media. As expected, there was a negative correlation between confidence in the government and vulnerability. The greater the confidence in the government's messages that tended to downplay the seriousness of the virus, the less likely people were to regard the disease as a threat or see themselves as vulnerable to it. However, confidence in the media worked differently. The alarming messages and constant reporting increased the perceived vulnerability and the number of protective actions taken. Vulnerability reduced the confidence in the hospitals but also increased the number of protective actions taken.",

In turn, the correlation matrix and the regression analysis showed that self-confidence had a positive effect on the adoption of preventive measures. This is an important finding indicating that adopting preventive measures requires that people feel they have the ability to do so successfully (Bish and Michie, 2010) . A possible explanation, reported in a recent comparative study on the adoption of protective measures in China and Israel, is that self-confidence helps to overcome social constraints in the implementation of social distance and protective behaviors (Liu and Mesch, 2020) . Without such self-confidence, social policies may not be effective and not achieve the goal of reducing the contagion.",

The theory highlights both concepts as having main effects on protective behaviors but does not consider the interrelationship between them (Freudenburg, 2001) . We found that the effect of social institutions was not consistent, as confidence in the government actually reduced the number of preventive behaviors adopted. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that perceived vulnerability, measured as the emotional feeling of fear and the cognitive evaluation of risk, mediated the effect of confidence social institutions on the adoption of behaviors. Our findings indicate that the effect of vulnerability on protective behaviors depends on self-confidence, confidence in the government and confidence in health workers. Thus, the effect of confidence in social institutions on the adoption of protective behaviors is enhanced or muted based on variation in levels of perceived vulnerability. This finding is the innovation of our study. It identifies a mechanism that was previously not mentioned with regard to recreancy theory on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f way the central constructs of the theory motivate the adoption of protective measures during a pandemic.",

First, while the study includes a large sample of respondents, it is based on a population of students at a large university in the State of Sao Paulo. Thus, the sample is limited in its representativeness of the population of Brazil and cannot be generalized to the total population. Future studies should investigate the extent to which our findings may be generalized. Second, we found that vulnerability is an important mediator of the effect of confidence in social institutions on protective behaviors. Given the centrality of this measure, future studies should conduct a more in-depth investigation of the sources of perceived vulnerability.",

Our moderator variable is vulnerability. To measure the concept of vulnerability, we followed the work of Ding et al. (2019) and used four items. Two are measures of estimation of risk (5-item Likert): \"Do you think you are at high risk of getting sick from COVID-19?\" \"Do you think that if you get sick, the disease will be serious. Another two measures were used to tap the emotional or fear component of the virus: \"How afraid are you of getting the coronavirus?\" How afraid are you that one of your close family members will contract the COVID-19 virus?\" The responses were measured using a Likert scale ranging from \"not at all\" to \"very afraid/a high risk.\" The variables were combined into a single scale by adding the values of the responses to individual items.

In terms of confidence in social institutions, the results indicate variability in the extent of confidence in each social institution.

However, confidence in hospitals did not affect the adoption of protective measures 95% CI [-0.50, 0.22], despite not being statistically significant it shows a negative tendency. In addition, consistent with the bivariate results, there was a negative relationship between confidence in the government and the adoption of protective measures 95% CI [-1.60, -0.94]. The explained variance of the model was R 2 =0.15, higher than the explained variance by the control variables alone (R 2 =0.02). In the final model we introduced the moderating variable, vulnerability, which represents both people's emotional fear and cognitive evaluation of their personal risk of becoming infected. By respecting the hierarchical principle that any interaction effect must also be included as a main effect, we also included vulnerability as an independent variable in the model. Our analysis revealed that vulnerability had a positive effect, indicating the crucial role of fear and risk evaluations in the adoption of protective measures 95% CI [7.00, 8.50]. The addition of all of the study's variables increased the explained variance significantly compared to the baseline ], and vulnerability*confidence in health workers 95% CI [-0.29, -0.07]. However, there was a positive interaction between vulnerability*confidence in the government 95% CI [0.08, 0.27]. These three statistically significant effects indicate that the effect of vulnerability on protective behaviors depends on selfconfidence, confidence in the government and confidence in health workers. More specifically, vulnerability mitigates the positive effect between self-confidence and the adoption of protective behaviors. In addition, perceptions of vulnerability enhance the negative effect between confidence in the government's ability to cope with the public health crisis and the adoption of protective behaviors. Finally, perceptions of vulnerability to the COVID-19 virus enhance the positive effect between confidence in health workers and the adoption of protective behavior measures.
