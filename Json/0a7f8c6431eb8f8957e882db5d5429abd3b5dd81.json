Missing natural foods in the diet raise the need of biologically active food components that could compensate for this deficiency and help maintain proper immune status. In this study, the microbial changes in pigs as experimental animals were assessed as influenced by consumption of oregano extract combination with peppermint and thyme essential oils. The results demonstrated that the combination of plant extracts had a positive effect on the gastrointestinal tract of animals by increasing the number of probiotic bacteria. Based on the results obtained it may be outlined that the combination of oregano extract and peppermint and thyme essential oils can be promising ingredient as a functional component for the development of the new nutraceutical preparation.",

This study used pigs as an animal model for the assessment of the impact of consumption of Origanum vulgare plant extract combined with Mentha piperita and Thymus vulgaris essential oils on microbial profile in intestines. A single group of weaned pigs received basal diet, while the other group basal diet supplemented with plant extract and two essential oils in the form of bilayer tablets prepared using \"liquid/solid\" phase technology. Metagenomic sequencing was performed with the aim to investigate changes of microbial communities in ileum, caecum, and colon. The results demonstrated that the combination of essential oils was non cytotoxic, and had a positive effect on the microbial composition in the large intestine of pigs due to significant increase in the number of probiotic bacteria. The amount of Lactobacillus was 2.5 Animals 2020, 10, 1734 2 of 18 times and Bifidobacterium 1.9 times higher in the animal group fed with supplement. The combination, however, had some negative impact on the variety of minor species in the distal part of the ileum. Additional studies need to be performed to obtain knowledge on how combinations of essential oils can change bacterial variety in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract.",

            "text": "Recent advances in Next Generation Sequencing allow us to explore microbial communities very efficiently, compared with investigations based on classical microbiological methods. As there is still a lack of information how do EOs acts on the human metabolism and microbial composition, many studies have been performed using animals and particularly pigs as experimental model. The pig model is one of the best preclinical animal models for investigating the gastrointestinal system and its functions in humans and it is widely used for in vivo experiments searching for healthier foods [20, 21] . The possibility to feed animals with supplementation of EOs is also promising from few perspectives including economic reasons and reducing of antimicrobial usage. There are data that the cinnamaldehyde and thymol (250 mg/kg) can significantly improve digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, and energy in piglets [22, 23] . The apparent ileal digestibility of crude protein and most amino acids were improved by the cocktail of EOs (300 mg/kg) with menthol as the primary component [24] . The mechanism of action of EOs is not very clear, but according to some studies, the improved digestibility can be attributed to the enhanced secretion of bile and enzymes [25] and to the decreased endogenous losses of nutrients [24] . EOs can also modify intestinal microbial composition in weaned piglets and therefore can enrich biosynthesis of proteins and to activate metabolism of lipids [26] . EOs have also been shown to regulate intestinal contraction, and thereby to influence the transit of digesta and the resultant interaction between feed and the endogenous enzymes. In pigs the active substances of EOs were found to be absorbed nearly completely in the stomach and the proximal small intestine within 2 h after oral administration [27] . This means that the absorption of EOs in the foregut protects the possibility of active substances to reach large intestines and directly act on the microbial communities. It is known that microbial changes in the large intestines appear after supplementing of feed by unprotected EOs [26] . This means that there are other pathways to active substances of EOs interacts with gut microbial communities. However, for the different drug relaxation in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) different types of pharmaceutical coatings are used. The \"liquid/solid\" coating technique is capable addition toward such an aim for solubility enhancement and dissolution improvement, thereby increasing the bioavailability. It contains liquid medications in powdered form. This technique is an efficient method for formulating water insoluble and water soluble drugs [28] .",

For instance, a cocktail of carvacrol, cinnamaldehyde, and capsicum oleoresin increased the population of Lactobacilli and the ratio of Lactobacilli to Enterobacteriaceae in the jejunum and cecum of early-weaned piglets [29] . The way EOs active substances can modify microbial composition is very important as it is known that the microbiota plays a fundamental role in the induction, training, and functioning of the host immune system [30] . It also actively participates in the digestion process. Bacteria belonging to phylum Firmicutes are able to digest long-chain carbohydrates and thus provide the host with additional sources of nutrients [31] . In addition to its positive role, microbiota has a potential in the development of irritable bowel disease and some other diseases, as well as obesity [32] . It may also elaborate toxic products from food residues such as genotoxic hydrogen sulphide [33] . As the microbiota has the potential to play different roles in the gut of the host, it is very important to explore the key elements influencing the domination of beneficial bacteria over the pathogenic ones or those that may have a negative impact on health. Different EOs have been investigated regarding their antimicrobial and functional properties. The previous investigations proved that the potential of activity of different EOs is not equal [34] ; therefore, the selection of an appropriate EOs with the aim to obtain the most active (or optimal) composition is very important.",

This plant also has strong antioxidative properties [36] . The aforementioned pharmacological properties of Origanum vulgare are attributed to its high content in carvacrol and other phenolic compounds [37] . Peppermint (Mentha piperita) is another widespread plant recognized for their special qualities such as anti-bacterial, stimulative, diaphoretic, stomachic, and anti-spasmodic. It reliefs against cold, flu, fever, anorexia, nausea, motion sickness, food poisoning, esophagus and sinus illnesses [38] [39] [40] . Thyme (Thymus vulgaris), which belongs to the Lamiaceae family, is rich source of phytochemicals and bioactive compounds. [41] . Thyme EO also inhibits growth of pathogenic bacteria and is known as an anti-fungal Animals 2020, 10, 1734 4 of 18 agent [42] . Among this, thymus possesses antispasmodic, diaphoretic, antiseptic, disinfectant, carminative, sedative, and expectorant properties that are due to thymol and carvacrol [43] . As aforementioned, herbs have wide spectrum of activity the composition of herbs and their EOs are expected to have even wider spectrum of activity including their ability to act on microorganisms and therefore to modify microbiota within the gut. The possibility to reduce the dose of a single essential oil and the usage of a cocktail of EOs can be important to reduce the toxicity of a single active substance as the main active substances from EOs such as thymol and carvacrol are known as toxic at least for plants and insects [44, 45] . The necessity to explore EOs influence on the microbial communities in the gut is actual for both humans and animals. With the aim to develop nutraceuticals we have explored different active ingredients including bovine colostrum, probiotics and various plant by-products. Here we have investigated the mix of EOs with possibility to include the selected composition as ingredient into the nutraceutical formulation.",

Pigs were bred and delivered from the large capacity pig breeding farm to the Biological Research Centre of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences keeping requirements of animal welfare. Animals were selected from the same two related litters, with the aim to obtain individuals with more similar physiological parameters including body weight. All animal procedures were conducted according to the EU Directive of the European Parliament and of Council from 22 September 2010 [47] on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and Requirements for the Keeping, Maintenance, and Use of Animals Intended for Science and Education Purposes (2010/63/EU), approved by the order of the Director of the Lithuanian State Food and Veterinary Service [48] . The number of permission for this study is G2-123. The animals were divided into two groups (control group and experimental group), eight pigs (four males and four females) in each group in separate pens within the same room. All animals were fed regular animal feed, which was prepared according to the standard recipes. Regular feed consisted of barley (44.6%), wheat (20%), soybean meal (7.9%), whey powder (6.5%), corn (5%), soybean protein (3%), sugar beet pulp (3%), and potato protein (2%). Before experiment, the animals were kept in pens for 5 days for adaptation. All animals in the experimental group additionally received~1 g of the preparation (3 tablets) daily, during the morning feeding until the end of the experiment. This corresponds to 986 mg of oregano extract, 3 mg of peppermint essential oil and 7 mg thyme essential oil. The preparation was added to the feed ensuring that it was consumed by each animal. Duration of the experiment was 30 days. Twenty-four hours before the experiment, fecal content from the rectum was taken for microbiome studies for the comparison of microbial variety among the groups. On the 30th day, the experiment was finished, and animals were sedated and euthanized according to the requirements laid down in the Directive.2010/63/EU. The content (5 g) from the distal part of the ileum, caecum and the central part of the colon was taken into sterile DNase and RNase free tubes, delivered to the Institute of Microbiology and Virology, where specimens were preserved using DNA/RNA Shield (Zymo Research, Irvine, USA) and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C. The material was used for microbiome studies in experimental and control animal groups.",

The obtained DNA then was purified using a DNA Clean & Concentrator-25 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA) to produce about 50 ng/\u00b5L of DNA. The same amount of DNA from each group of animals was pooled into one sample per group representing one sample per intestine i.e., three samples were obtained from each group representing samples from ileum, caecum and colon. In total, six samples were obtained representing three intestines from both animal groups. Partial 16S rRNA genes (V3-V4) were PCR amplified followed by barcoding and library preparation of the resulting PCR products in a secondary PCR. Metagenomic libraries were prepared, sequenced, quality controlled, and assembled in an independent service laboratory (BaseClear, The Netherlands). Short paired sequence reads were generated using the Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, IL, USA) and converted into FASTQ files using the BCL2FASTQ pipeline software, version 1.8.3 (Illumina, IL, USA). Subsequently, reads containing PhiX control signal were removed using an in-house filtering protocol. In addition, reads containing (partial) adapters were clipped (up to a minimum read length of 50 bp). The second quality assessment was based on the remaining reads using the FASTQC quality control tool version 0.11.5. Subsequently, the Illumina paired reads were merged into single reads (so-called \"pseudoreads\") through sequence overlap. Chimeric pseudoreads were removed, and the remaining reads were aligned to a combination of the GreenGenes and RDP 16S gene databases. Based on the alignment scores of the pseudoreads, the taxonomic classes were assigned by associating each pseudoread to the best matching operational taxonomic unit (OTU). The results of the taxonomic classification were presented on the interactive online platform. The number of probiotic bacteria was recorded and the relative number of probiotics from all bacteria detected was counted in all intestines tested as an average number per group. The bacterial genera considered as probiotic bacteria was based on literature analysis [49] [50] [51] and included Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Bacillus, Faecalibacterium, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Escherichia. Moreover, all the bacterial genera detected in the amount of \u22652%, irrespective of the animal group, were checked as to whether they were not mentioned as probiotic bacteria in scientific manuscripts.",

            "text": "At the end of the experiment, microbial profiles were examined is separate intestines, as bacteria of different genera unevenly prevail in different parts of the gut [56] . Significant changes were detected regarding bacterial composition in the ileum. Although taxonomical composition was similar in both groups, the amounts of separate genera were unequally distributed in the intestines of experimental group. The main changes were associated with an increase of Escherichia (almost three times) and Lactobacillus (five times) and a decrease of Prevotella (59 times) in the experimental group, compared with control pigs. Both Escherichia and Lactobacillus are considered as probiotic bacteria [57] ; therefore, EOs obviously had a positive effect on the numbers of those genera; however, Escherichia is also a possible pathogen and can be unwanted microorganism, depending on its pathogenicity. While virulence factors of E. coli were not investigated in this study, it should be taken into account that it could be investigated in forthcoming trials. Although Prevotella is usually found in pig GI tract in large amounts [58] , there is a lack of information about the importance of this genus in pigs. There are suggestions that Prevotella may play important roles to combat post-weaning diarrhoea and that it may contribute to nutrient transport and uptake in the pig gut ecosystem [59] . It is unclear, however, in which part of the GI tract Prevotella has the most important role, but according to the study performed previously, this bacterium is mostly distributed in the colon [56] . In our study, we found the highest amount of Prevotella present in the caecum, where it was the most predominant genus in both groups of pigs. Moreover, the amount of Prevotella in the caecum of experimental animals was significantly higher than in the control group; therefore, the total number of this genus in GI did not decrease in pigs fed with EEOs supplement. The species whose prevalence increased in the ileum of control animals were Escherichia coli and Lactobacillus amylovorus. The number of L. amylovorus increased 12 times and made 17% of total bacterial count from the jejuni. This species has adhesive and significant pathogen inhibitory efficacy and is recognized as potential candidate to be used as probiotic feed supplement [60] . Changes in the caecum content were mostly associated with an increase of Prevotella and Streptococcus and a decrease of Barnesiella and Denitrobacterium, compared with the control group. The amount of Barnesiella, however, was more than eight times less in the experimental group and was probably replaced by Prevotella and Streptococcus. Although Barnesiella has been found in many other studies investigating pig microbiome, there is still no clear information regarding its functions and significance. Denitrobacterium has a single species-D. detoxificans, which is better known as ruminant species and its significance in porcine GI is also still under-investigated. The increased genera in the caeca of experimental pigs therefore are considered as positive or even probiotic (Streptococcus) microbiota. The most prevalent species in the caeca of the experimental group of pigs was Prevotella copri, whose prevalence was 24.3%, and that is 3.5 times higher than in the control group. The role of this species in pigs is not known yet, but P. copri is a common human gut microorganism that is both positively and negatively associated with host health [61] . The role of P. copri in human health is debatable [62] . In a recent study, De Filippis et al. have detected distinct strains of P. copri by metagenome studies and showed that the diet might select distinctive P. copri populations [62] , but there is still no data about this in pigs. The most prevalent bacterial species in the caeca in the control group was Barnesiella intestinihominis, followed by P. copri. B. intestinihominis was also more prevalent in the colon content of experimental animals; therefore, there were no big differences in this species between the groups. B. intestinihominis has been better described in humans than in pigs and has also been mentioned in a study were this species together with Enterococcus hirae had a positive effect on the efficacy of cyclophosphamide used for cancer treatment in mice. The prevalence in healthy pigs of species that were previously associated with human microbiota, demonstrates the similarity between human and porcine microbiota. This fact is important as pig model can gain more knowledge about the pathogenesis of different human diseases. Variety of the rest of the species in the caecum content was similar in both groups demonstrating that EEOs did not have a selective inhibitory effect on the main species normally inhabiting the GI of pigs. Such variety similarities were also observed in other large intestines. The amount of some genera and species, however, differed significantly. In the colon, these differences were also noticeable: while in the control group the most prevalent genus was Streptococcus, in the experimental group predominated Prevotella. Among streptococci the most prevalent species were S. lutetiensis and S. gallolyticus, whose prevalence reached almost 30%. Those species were also detected in the experimental group but only in a small amount (1.7%). It is not clear yet if these species of streptococci are widely distributed in pigs, but they are frequently encountered in blood cultures of humans with bacteremia, sepsis, and endocarditis [63] . Recently, Piva et al. described the first case of isolation of S. lutetiensis from a diseased cat [64] . S. lutetiensis and S. gallolyticus belong to the group of S. bovis from which they were separated into separate species [63] . While S. lutetiensis is well known as pathogenic species in humans, particularly in patients with reduced immunity, S. gallolyticus is recognized as an inhabitant of the alimentary tract of cattle, sheep, and other ruminants [65] . This study revealed that both Streptococcus species can be abundant in the intestinal tract of pigs and proves that pigs are carriers of streptococcal species pathogenic to humans. For this reason, S. gallolyticus and, particularly, S. lutetiensis can be considered as zoonotic bacteria. On the other hand, this is not certain for types or strains that might differ between the hosts, thus more studies in this direction should be performed. S. gallolyticus is known to be transmitted either directly or indirectly between animals and humans [66] . It is also important to note that S. gallolyticus is genetically close to the other species-S. suis-which is known as a normal inhabitant of the oral cavity of pigs [67] . There are data that it is sometimes difficult to correctly identify S. suis, and even molecular methods, including PCR, have a risk of misidentifying S. gallolyticus as S. suis [68, 69] . As in this study S. suis was detected in very low amounts, taxonomic distribution of Streptococcus species should be further studied for more accurate identification. The rest of the species in the colon were more equally distributed by their variety and numbers in both groups of pigs, although big differences were also observed regarding Clostridium cellulovorans, which had a higher prevalence in the control group, and different species of Prevotella, which were more prevalent in the experimental group. C. cellulovorans is known as widely distributed bacteria, which is also found in porcine respiratory tract; however, there is no clear information about its role in pigs.",

The data demonstrated that pigs receiving EEOs supplements had a higher amount of bacteria that are considered as probiotics, including Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Escherichia. Only Streptococcus and Enterococcus, which are also probiotic species, were more numerous in the control group of pigs. The overall number of probiotic bacteria in the experimental group was 1.2 times higher compared to controls and accounted for 27% of the total amount of bacterial reads in the gut of pigs. The number of Lactobacillus was 2.5 times higher, while the number of Bifidobacterium was 1.9 times higher in the experimental group. The amount of Streptococcus, however, was four times higher in the control group. As the lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, are among the better described probiotic bacteria, the role of streptococci for the host is less investigated. This genus is mostly known as a pathogenic for pigs causing different diseases and, particularly, S. suis infections via skin injuries, which manifest as meningitis and other clinical expressions. There are data that natural probiotics can be a promising tool in cancer prevention and therapy for humans [70] ; therefore, the obtained results can be important from the perspective of the usage of nutraceutical preparations containing EEOs. Moreover, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are the genera already known as suppressors of cell proliferation in tumors; their action is associated with oxidative stress [70, 71] . Although EOs anticancer potential is known by acting by multiple pathways and mechanisms, involving apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, antimetastatic and antiangiogenic action, increased levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), and DNA repair modulation [72] -this study reveals that they can also act indirectly, by increasing populations of probiotic bacteria in the host.",

Ultrasonication and fermentation of bovine colostrum allowed us to obtain decontaminated colostrum with increased functionality and reduced amount of cadaverine, histamine, and tyramine [74] . A new delivery system based on apple pomace-pectin gels ensured the viability of antimicrobial strains [75] . Current experiment in vivo demonstrated a positive effect of EEOs on the microbiota of the GI tract without reducing variety of species in the large intestine and increasing the number of probiotic bacteria. The study also demonstrated that EEOs combination has no cytotoxic effect at high concentrations (up to 50 \u00b5L/mL). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of EOs on different pathogenic strains in our previous study were lower [5] than concentrations which had no cytotoxic effect established in the present study. As there was a decrease of some probiotic bacteria, in particular, gram-positive cocci, more data are required about the possible action of the current EEOs combination on this group of bacteria and about the role of Streptococcus spp. in the gut of vertebrates. Moreover, as the EEOs had a certain negative impact on species variety in the ileum, studies on the role of minor species of bacteria in small intestine should be further studied.",
