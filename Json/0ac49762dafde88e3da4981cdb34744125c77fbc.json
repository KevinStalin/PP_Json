One reason for this is that a lower quality of institutional framework, which includes the judicial system, distorts the incentive structure for investment and its dynamics (Knack and Keefer, 1995; Nawaz, 2015; Eslamloueyan and Jafari, 2019) . This, in turn, implies lower investment rates. A critical feature of the general channel that connects justice and investment is that an ineffective judicial system generates insecurity and distrust. On the private contracting side, this is because firms expect that the judicial system will resolve more slowly (or less confidently) disputes arising from the specificity of investments. That is, the parties to a contract fear getting involved with opportunistic companies (i.e., a hold-up problem) in an investment relationship (Klein et al., 1978; Levchenko, 2007) . In addition, an ineffective judicial system is a weaker barrier to expropriation by the public sector, which in turn discourages investment. Therefore, faced with an ineffective judicial system, companies would avoid making an investment that depends on unknown companies; this effectively serves as a barrier to entry for new providers. Such companies may also look for internal solutions outside the market (such as becoming vertically integrated with providers or customers), and as a result would invest less (Klein et al., 1978; Johnson et al., 2002; Nunn, 2007) .",

Many similar cases could be discussed, such as attempts to purchase laboratory equipment and elevators, because this type of equipment is usually ordered with a series of adaptations -which, in turn, reduces their external market value.

This paper addresses these questions and discusses specific transmission channels based on two rich databases that cover investment decisions for more than 650,000 Spanish firms (3.5 million observations) (CBI -Integrated CBSO-Central de Balances Integrada of the Banco de Espa\u00f1a) and information on the functioning of the judicial system at the local level over the period 2002 .

Our paper is novel in documenting an obstacle to investment that more severely affects this type of firm. We also examine the differential effect by sector of activity, and find that the negative effect of judicial inefficacy is more pronounced in the industrial sector. Finally, regarding the relationship between vertical integration and the impact of judicial inefficacy, we find that firms that are less dependent on intermediate inputs are less affected by the congestion rate. This finding is in line with previous theoretical work by Klein et al. (1978) and Johnson et al. (2002) . The specific channels that explain these differences are, on the one hand, the greater importance of the private contractual channel in a developed economy (which is the one regulated by the civil jurisdiction) and, on the other hand, the greater intensity and frequency of investments in larger companies relative to smaller ones.",

More specifically, we select firms which are listed in the database at least two years in the period 1997-2016 and apply standard cleaning procedures to the considered variables. Because our measures of judicial efficacy cover the years 2002-2016, we further restrict our sample to this particular period 5 . The final sample that we use in the estimates has more than 3.5 million observations for a total of 653,289 firms. Since we identify their location, we are able to cross them with local judicial efficacy data. . Our main variable of interest is the investment rate of firms. As a measure of investment, we compute the gross investment ratio at the firm level. This is the sum between the gross formation of tangible fixed capital and the gross formation of intangible fixed capital, divided by the sum of the total capital stock. Notably, our measure captures both the extensive (decision to invest) and intensive (magnitude) margins of investment decisions.",

This is important because the conflicts related to investment decisions do not have preference to be judged in the Spanish courts. Therefore, an enterprise is affected by the congestion of the civil jurisdiction in general (as a result of business conflicts but also family conflicts) and will make its decisions accordingly. 11 Figure 3 shows the time variation of the congestion rate in the civil jurisdiction when solving a \"declarative\" judgment) for the whole economy (as a simple average across provinces over time): on average, the congestion rate was higher during the economic crisis and we only observe a slight reduction in the last observation (2016) already in the expansion period. This suggests that inefficacy in the Spanish judicial system may be countercyclical. Already, Ginsburg and Hoetker (2006) and Palumbo et al. (2013) found international evidence in this regard.

The OECD was only able to collect (partial) information of its use (%) to resolve commercial disputes through arbitration and conciliation in 10 countries among which Spain was not available. As a result, we do not have enough statistical information to incorporate the ADRs into the estimates. However, the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f reading of the results remains useful insofar as it analyzes the functioning of the judicial system and this is the enforcement mechanism that also covers conflicts related to the ADRs (it is the judicial system which, ultimately, would also resolve a conflict related to the use of the ADRs).",

The main channel through which firm's characteristics may be correlated with judicial congestion is through 13 An alternative to our approach is the estimation of a dynamic investment model. Either if employing difference-GMM (Arellano and Bond, 1991) or system-GMM (Arellano and Bover, 1995; Blundell and Bond, 1998) , appropriate empirical identification relies on having valid instrumental variables (i.e. assumptions should be assessed in a case-by-case basis). An important concern of the difference-GMM is that, for highly persistent controls, the lagged values of the variables in level may be weak instruments for their first difference transformation. In our case, some of our firm controls are very persistent (for example, the debt rate has a serial correlation coefficient of 0.9). On the other hand, system-GMM uses lagged differenced variables as instruments in the level equation relying on the assumption that the controls are mean stationary. Arguably, the presence of the Great Recession (structural break) and observed trends in some of our controls invalidates this assumption. For these reasons, we follow the static alternative approach of Gulen and Ion (2016) and Baker et al. (2016) . 14 The information about congestion was obtained for the first time in 2002. But since we use a lag, the period remains at t = 2003-2016. 15 In appendix C, we show that our results are robust to clustering at the province and year level. 16 Our results are robust to the use of two-and three-year lags for firm investment determinants and aggregate controls. While considering longer lags may reduce further the reverse causality concern, it decreases the relevance of investment determinants and their role as controls for unobserved factors. We, thus, perform our analysis considering one-year lagged controls. economic conditions. Introducing profitability variables attempts to control for firm's investment opportunities, which is an unobservable determinant. Despite many authors rely on the use of the Tobin's q measure, the nature of our data (with a high proportion of SMEs) implies considering alternative proxies for investment opportunities. Namely, we control for the return on assets and sales growth. On the other hand, we control for the financial position of the firm which may also influence investment decisions through the credit channel. Namely, we control for the debt to asset ratio, the debt burden and cash-flows. Note that by controlling for this battery of firms' characteristics, we are (to our best possible) controlling for the cost of capital and the firm-specific interest rate that a company may face to finance investment.",

(2017), a possible source of concern for the validity of the analysis could be that conflicts of companies located in a province \"p\" could be solved in any other province \"no p\".

Still, we believe that these exceptions should not be a relevant problem for our estimates. On the one hand, we observe that the provinces are an important \"frontier\" to economic activity in Spain: workers tend to move only within the province limits (Jimeno et al. 2015) . According to the Labor Force Survey, workers commuting to a province other than their province of residence amounted to 4.6% during the period 2005-2013 and firms changing province amount to just around 0.1% each year. 17 On the other, in the extreme and unrealistic event that firms actually self-selected provinces for litigation, our estimate of the average effect of judicial congestion on investment would be a lower bound of the true effect. Judicial congestion at province \"p\" would be irrelevant to investment for all firms located in \"p\" that litigate in \"no p\".

We expect to observe a negative effect of a higher congestion rate on investment as suggested by the negative relationship between the averages of the variables for each province (see figure 1 ). Following the specification presented in section 3, our empirical exercise will allow us to establish a causal claim on such relationship by controlling for other firm-specific and aggregate determinants of investment and to investigate potential heterogeneous effects. Our result is robust to the inclusion of controls at the province level. Arguably, our estimation could be affected by potential confounders. For example, for a given number of courts in a province, population and firm density could be important determinants of judicial congestion rates and could plausibly be related to investment behavior of firms. In column 3 we introduce a block of controls to alleviate concerns of such potential confounders. In particular, we control for the number of lawyers in each province (as suggested by Mora-Sanguinetti and Garoupa (2015), as this variable is related to litigation), the ratio of total number of civil courts in a province over the sum of total population plus number of firms and the population growth.

The dependent variable is the investment rate. We account for firm fixed effects by means of the within transformation. We also account for year fixed effects. Standard errors are two-way clustered at both the firm and year level. Column 1 presents a classical investment regression model where only firmlevel variables are included. Column 2 augments the model by including our main regressor of interest, judicial congestion at the declarative stage, measured at the province level. Columns 3 to 5 introduce further controls at the province level. All variables are lagged by one year. The considered sample covers the period 2002-2016. Table 3 considers the effect of judicial congestion when we focus on the execution stage.

Arguably, the lower relevance of congestion at the execution stage could be related with the fact that less firms do actually reach this second stage and thus the overall sensitivity to judicial efficacy is lower. This circumstance also indicates that companies have some confidence in the effectiveness of the judicial system once, unfortunately, a conflict has occurred (usually there would be no need to carry out forced execution).

In a poorly developed economy, the risks of expropriation could be high. Spain is, instead, a developed economy where the risk of expropriation by the public sector is lower. In addition, Acemoglu and Johnson argue that the contractual channel may not be as important because agents may alter the terms of formal and informal contracts to avoid the poor quality of that part of the institutional framework. Although this \"avoidance\" process could occur in Spain, it seems not to be the most frequent case: the high level of litigation in civil jurisdiction (in the OECD top 4 as already indicated) suggests a high dependence of economic agents on judicial decisions. In other words, companies and citizens very often choose to litigate within the formality of the judicial system to resolve their disputes in Spain.",

The two first characteristics have been largely considered in the literature to classify the profile of firms and their investment behavior. For the case of Spain and using a very similar sample to ours, Herranz and Martinez-Carrascal (2016) and document that small firms invest less on average than larger firms and with a lower frequency. Together with this, smaller and younger firms are typically considered to be more vulnerable to information frictions and thus, to suffer more from credit constraints and uncertainty (Garc\u00eda-Posada, 2018 and Gulen and Ion, 2016) . In a second exercise, we consider possible heterogenous effects of congestion on investment by intermediate input's use.

This is because sectors differ noticeably in their dependence on complex investment decisions requiring long-term interactions. The median knowledge (or intangible) capital intensity (OECD, 2017; Corrado et al., 2009 ) was above in manufacturing with respect to any other sector (ranging from agriculture to \"other services\"), with the only exception of trade and finance 20 . Although our results should be read with caution (as the breakdown by sector analysed is limited), this paper provides evidence that, indeed, 19 Note that, despite the fact that the effect of constant or almost-constant firm-specific characteristics are absorbed by company fixed-effects, we are still able to properly identify the corresponding heterogeneous effects of judicial congestion along these dimensions. This stems from the fact that we are interacting the variables with our measure of congestion, which exhibits time variation (Wooldridge et al., 2001, Ch. 10.5) . 20 The study was conducted by aggregating information from Spain and 13 other European countries (OECD 2015) . sectors such as industry or trade suffer more in a context of legal uncertainty, which implies less investment.",

Namely, the effect is close to the average effect for the case of small firms, our baseline category and significant at the 5% confidence level (as expected, as small firm represent 96% of our sample) but doubles in magnitude and triples in magnitude when considering medium and large firms, respectively. Furthermore, for medium and large firms, the effect is always found to be significant at the 1% significance level. This finding is robust when considering alternative modelling specifications (see Appendix C). On the other hand, panel B presents the differential effects of judicial inefficacy for firms with different ages. Once again, significant effects are only found for the case of congestion at the declarative stage. We observe that mature firms are more affected by judicial congestion in a relevant order of magnitude.

Our hypothesis is that, conditional on other characteristics, the more advisors a company has (signaling a better understanding of the general ecosystem of the company, including the judicial environment), the more we expect investment to react to lagged congestion rate. We merge the information of Amadeus-Orbis with our database, ending up with a sub-sample of 45000 firms, out of which more than two thirds of the firms are medium and large firms. Hence, we conduct our exercise on a very particular composition of our sample which makes comparison to previous results difficult. Appendix D presents our main findings, which we interpret as a suggestive correlation with no causal implications. We observe that the congestion rate affects more severely firms that rely more on external advisors, in line with the channel we were exploring. The effect is significant for specifications in where we do not include firm-fixed effects but vanishes-out once we control for firm unobserved heterogeneity.

In the baseline specification, we tackle this concern by introducing different controls such as measures of population and firm density per region, GDP growth and unemployment rate. In column (1) of Table C .2 we further saturate our model with province-year fixed effects which allows us to control for all observed and unobserved province trends. Note that introducing province-year fixed effects entails that we can no longer identify the effect of congestion rate (neither the effect of any other control at the province level), because they will be colinear with the fixed effects. Still, we can identify the interaction between the congestion rate and firm-specific level variables 22 . Notably, the coefficients of the interaction terms remain of similar magnitude and significance to the ones shown in table 5. On the other hand, in column (2) of table C.2 we allow for clustering at the province and year level. Allowing for intra-province correlation among observations and over time implies a much more conservative inference standard of our estimated coefficients. At the same time, the specification may suffer from insufficient number of clusters to rely on asymptotic theory. We see that the main effects of our interaction terms remain unchanged after allowing for this alternative clustering strategy.",

Both findings are consistent with the role of financial frictions in the access to credit and investment. Classical investment determinants remain significant and affecting the investment rate in the expected direction. The judicial congestion rate measured at the declaration stage has a negative effect on the investment rate, even after controlling for firm specific characteristics and time fixed effects. Controlling for aggregate shocks ensures that our estimators are not contaminated by the impact that the business cycle may have on both the investment rate and judicial congestion. In particular, we find that a 10-percentage point decrease in the congestion rate would increase on average the investment rate by roughly 0.1 percentage points, caeteris paribus. In order to have a better sense of the relevance of this magnitude an example may be helpful. In year 2010, Alicante was one of the provinces with higher levels of judicial congestion (220 unresolved cases per 100 resolved ones), while Alava exhibited one of the lowest level of congestion (140 unresolved cases per 100 resolved ones). If Alicante had the judicial efficacy observed in Alava, investment in Alicante would increase by \u0394 \u202b\u074a\u0745\u0750\u074f\u0741\u0743\u074a\u0725\u202c \u202b\u0741\u0750\u073d\u0734\u202c * \u07da \u0b36 = \u202b08\u202c * 0.01 = 0.8 \u202b,\u202c which is a magnitude similar to the effect that a 10-pp increase in cash flows has on average on the level of investment.",

Table D .2b presents the correlation of judicial inefficacy on investment when looking at the group of firms with no advisors, firms with between 1 and 5 advisors, and firms that have more than 5 different advisors.
