It has been proposed that vascular endotheliitis caused by either an activated immune reaction or direct infection of the vascular endothelium with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may cause coagulopathy. However, the pathophysiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is not well understood. The occurrence of pulmonary embolism (PE) has been reported in COVID-19 patients, mainly in Europe and the USA. The incidence of PE is high in severe or critical COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission [1] . However, there have been few reports of PE associated with COVID-19 in Japan, and PE is a rare complication of non-severe COVID-19. Therefore, the incidence of PE in patients with nonsevere COVID-19 and measures to best prevent coagulopathy have not been elucidated. Here, we report a case of non-severe COVID-19 without any risk of thrombosis that was diagnosed as PE based on prolonged serum D-dimer elevation.",

D-dimer levels were only slightly elevated, there were no changes with his haemodynamics or respiratory status (oxygen saturation: 94% on room air), and the patient experienced neither oedema nor gripping pain in his lower extremities. Three days post-hospital admission, his fever and CRP levels gradually improved, and five days postadmission, his fever had almost resolved, inflammatory markers, such as CRP (1.97 mg/L) and ferritin (366 ng/mL), were significantly improved. In addition, his PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. However, D-dimer levels remained elevated (6.5 \u03bcg/mL) and deviated from the other clinical and laboratory findings. Although he had no symptoms including dyspnoea even when he walked and respiratory status was not changed (oxygen saturation: 97% on room air), we performed contrast CT in order to identify PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Contrast CT revealed PE of the right pulmonary artery (Fig. 1C, D) , while no DVT or other thrombosis was detected. We initiated continuous heparin infusion to treat PE. Screening tests for autoimmune disease and congenital coagulation abnormalities, such as activated protein C, activated protein S, antinuclear antibody, anti-double stranded DNA, immunoglobulin G, anti-cardiolipin-\u03b22-glycoprotein I complex antibody, and lupus anticoagulant were all negative. On day 11 post-admission, we replaced heparin with apixaban. D-dimer levels gradually decreased by day 11 post-admission (1.3 \u03bcg/mL), and the patient was discharged after being hospitalized for 17 days (Fig. 2) .",
