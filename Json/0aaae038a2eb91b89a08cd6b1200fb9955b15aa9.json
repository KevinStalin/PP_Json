Forty Japanese patients (once-weekly arm, n = 26; twice-weekly arm, n = 14) were randomized in A.R.R.O.W. In the Japanese subgroup of A.R.R.O.W., median PFS was 14.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.5-not evaluable [NE]) and 9.7 months (95% CI, 3.8-NE) in the once-and twice-weekly arms, respectively. The overall response rate (ORR) was 73.1% (19/26; 95% CI, 52.2-88.4) and 57.1% (8/14; 95% CI, 28.9-82.3) in each arm. The adverse events (AEs) incidence was 100% in both arms. Grade \u2265 3 AE incidence was 80.8% (21/26) and 78.6% (11/14) in each arm. Two fatal treatment-related AEs (acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome) occurred in the once-weekly arm. In exploratory unadjusted analyses of A.R.R.O.W.

In the Japanese subgroup, once-weekly Kd tended to improve ORR vs. twice-weekly Kd. Results from A.R.R.O.W. tended to be consistent with results from ENDEAVOR.",

In Japan, the annual incidence and 5-year prevalence rates of MM were reported to be 1.3-5.4 and 9.7 per 100,000 persons, respectively [1] . Given the better understanding of the disease and the advent of new treatments during the past decades, the overall survival (OS) of patients with MM has remarkably increased m 2 , and both treatment schedules had comparable safety. Herein, we describe the results of the Japanese subgroup of the A.R.R.O.W. study [13] . To date, no clinical studies have compared once-weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 with twiceweekly Kd 20/56 mg/m 2 . To compare the outcomes of onceweekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 vs. twice-weekly Kd 20/56 mg/ m 2 , we compared data from subjects from the A.R.R.O.W. study who were treated with once-weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 with that of subjects from the ENDEAVOR study who were treated with twice-weekly Kd 20/56 mg/m 2 [7, 8] . Owing to key differences in the eligibility of subjects from the ENDEAVOR and A.R.R.O.W. studies in terms of prior number of therapies, refractoriness to the most recent therapy, and prior use of a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drugs, we conducted an exploratory unadjusted analysis using subjects from the ENDEAVOR study whose criteria met that of both the overall and Japanese populations of the A.R.R.O.W. study.",

In the once-weekly arm, 61.5% of patients had an unknown risk determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, followed by 19.2% each for high and standard risk, while in the twice-weekly arm, half of the patients had an unknown risk status, but 28.6% were at high risk, and 21.4% were at standard risk. All patients had received either two or three prior treatment regimens. Patients in the once-weekly arm received a median of 2.5 prior treatments, and those in the twice-weekly arm received a median of 2.4 prior treatments. Prior treatment regimens included bortezomib (100%), lenalidomide (92.5%), or thalidomide (27.5% ",

Those higher ratios observed in the once-weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 arm were most likely attributed to the different evaluation periods: median durations of the study drug administration in the Japanese subgroups were 55.8 weeks in the once-weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 arm and 37.3 weeks in the twice-weekly Kd 20/27 mg/m 2 arm. As compared to Japanese patients treated with the twice-weekly Kd 20/56 mg/m 2 for 154 days in the ENDEAVOR study, Japanese patients treated with the once-weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 for the same 154-day period exhibited similar incidences of AEs, including AEs with grade 3 or more, fatal AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation.

Unfortunately, the details and information regarding the ALI case were limited. However, the patient who presented ARDS had an underlying respiratory condition (pneumonia secondary to influenza virus) that may have predisposed the patient to develop respiratory complications. Regarding cardiac failure in relation to carfilzomib treatment, no fatal cardiac failure event was reported in Japanese patients, but two (7.7%, 2/26) and one (7.1%, 1/14) grade 3 or higher cardiac failure events were reported in the once-weekly and twice-weekly arms, respectively. One patient in the Japanese subgroup from A.R.R.O.W. receiving once-weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 presented TMA. Furthermore, TMA was also reported in the phase 1 study that assessed the tolerability of Kd 20/70 mg/ m 2 in Japanese patients [12] . Although the occurrence of TMA is infrequent, once TMA occurs, it can become a serious event. Patients who develop TMA during carfilzomib CI confidence interval, Kd carfilzomib (Kyprolis) plus dexamethasone, NE not estimable a Best overall response is defined as a subject's best response during the study b Median and percentiles were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.

Corresponding CIs were estimated using the method by Klein and Moeschberger treatment require careful attention and prompt management, including plasmapheresis, which may improve the outcome of these patients. Still, the present findings reinforce the need to closely monitor RRMM patients receiving Kd for ALI/ ARDS, cardiac failure, and TMA during treatment. Nonetheless, the overall benefit-risk profile of once-weekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 was favorable among Japanese patients. Exploratory analyses of the Japanese subgroup from the A.R.R.O.W. and ENDEAVOR studies (i.e., patients who had received two to three prior therapies, were refractory to the most recent therapy, and with prior use of a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drugs), suggested that the efficacy of carfilzomib (ORR 73.1% [19/26] and 42.9% [3/7] and median PFS 14.8 months and NE in the Japanese subgroups from A.R.R.O.W. and ENDEAVOR, respectively) tended to be similar between trials. Selected overall patient populations from A.R.R.O.W. and ENDEAVOR also showed comparable efficacy, consistently with a recent report [16] . As this was an exploratory comparison and not a head-to-head comparison, it is difficult to conclusively compare the clinical benefits of once weekly Kd 20/70 mg/ m 2 and twice weekly Kd 20/56 mg/m 2 . In the ENDEAVOR trial, the median PFS of Asian patients was longer with Kd (14.9 months) than with Vd (8.8 months), and the ORR was 80.4% (45/56) vs. 70.2% (40/57), respectively [17] . Similarly, the median PFS of Asian patients in A.R.R.O.W. was longer for once-weekly (16.0 months) than for twice-weekly dosing (8.4 months), and the ORR was 76.7% (23/30) compared with 53.3% (8/15), respectively [17] .",

Furthermore, the time to deterioration was longer for those in the once-weekly arm compared with the twice-weekly arm. Thus, the present findings and those of the above report further support the convenience of the once-weekly regimen (studied in A.R.R.O.W.).",

As the number of patients in the Japanese cohort is small, the efficacy and safety data should be considered as purely descriptive, and limited conclusions can be drawn from comparing individual AEs. Furthermore, the cross-trial comparison with ENDEAVOR [7] was an exploratory comparison, not a head-to-head comparison, and it was not adjusted. While we are aware of the limitations of this type of comparison, we considered this analysis would be of value as there are limited published data from clinical trials comparing onceweekly Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 and twice-weekly Kd 20/56 mg/m 2 , both of which have been approved in Japan.",

Regarding the safety profile of both regimens, higher rates of treatment discontinuation, dose reduction, and serious AEs were reported in the once-weekly Kd arm vs. the twice-weekly arm. Exploratory analyses comparing the once-weekly Kd regimen used in A.R.R.O.W. (Kd 20/70 mg/m 2 ) and the twice-weekly Kd regimen used in ENDEAVOR (Kd 20/56 mg/m 2 ) suggested that while total exposure (weekly carfilzomib dosage) was lower with the once-weekly regimen, its efficacy was consistent with the twice-weekly regimen. Thus, the results observed in the Japanese subgroup are consistent with those observed in the overall A.R.R.O.W. (Asia Pacific, Europe, and North America) and the ENDEAVOR subgroup who met the following criteria: had two to three prior therapies, were refractory to the most recent therapy and had prior use of a proteasome inhibitor and immunomodulatory drug (Europe, North America, South America, and the Asia-Pacific region).
