[8] [9] [10] However, there has been little or no systematic research on people who were not hospitalised and it is even conceivable that a protracted illness may be more common in those whose acute illness was less severe. Whilst academic publications have estimated that 10-20% of people are still unwell after 3 weeks and 1-3% are still significantly unwell after 12 weeks, 3 8 self-surveys of patients recruited from long Covid peer support groups suggest a much high incidence of persistent symptoms even taking account of sampling bias (for example, several thousand people from the UK in such groups report symptoms six months after their acute illness, which suggests that the figure of 1% cannot be correct). 11 12 The high proportion of women in long Covid support groups 4 12 may or may not reflect a true gender difference in incidence.",

This brought a large response from interviewees reporting symptoms many weeks after their acute illness. We decided to undertake a focused study of such people with the following inclusion criteria: symptoms developed between February and July 2020 following an acute illness consistent with Covid-19; symptoms continued beyond 3 weeks. We contacted Covid-19 online patient support groups (LongCovidSOS, Long Covid Support, Longcovid.org, Patient Safety Learning, Positive Path of Wellness, Patient Voices) from which we identified a third online group of UK doctors with long Covid), and also advertised on social media (Twitter) using the #longcovid hashtag. We used snowballing from our initial sample to identify further participants who were not in online groups or users of social media. Potential participants were screened for eligibility and baseline demographic information collected (Table 1) . To correct for an initial gender and ethnic skew, we offered 'men only' focus groups and included additional rounds of invitations for participants from racial groups other than White British.",

The research team included both clinicians and social scientists. Our participants spanned a wide range of ages, ethnic and social backgrounds, and illness experiences -including, importantly, the under-researched majority who were never hospitalised. We oversampled men and people from non-White ethnic groups to partially correct an initially skewed sample. Offering the choice of interviews or focus groups allowed those with sensitive stories to tell to do so in private, and for all participants to select a method with which they were comfortable. The use of multiple linked sociological theories allowed to produce a rich theorisation of the lived experience of the illness and draw on that theorisation to produce principles and practical proposals for improving services. We included experts by experience (people with long Covid) as steering group members, co-interpreters of the data, co-authors on the paper and peer reviewers. The inclusion of a high proportion of healthcare workers both reflects the occupational risk in these groups 51 52 and allowed participants to draw on their system knowledge as well as their personal illness experience when suggesting improvements to services.",

Many had contacted the national telephone advice service, NHS111, as directed by public messaging, and reported what they felt were delayed, absent or inappropriate responses due to pressure on the service itself, a perception among providers that their symptoms were less serious than they actually were, or lack of clearly defined care pathways for patients with long-term persisting symptoms.One day I had blue finger nails and I wasn't cold and my husband was working at home at the time and I said to him and he looked, I mean I'd real proper cyanosis on all my finger nails and I phoned the GP and the GP answer phone said if you've got any of the signs of, of Covid please ring 111 and so I rang 111 and, I live in [city with high incidence of Covid-19] I don't know if that makes any difference but I was put on hold and after over an hour, an hour and twenty minutes nobody answered so I just put the phone down because I was listening to music and a looped tape of what the symptoms were and I was getting, going crazy (Participant from Allied Health Professionals FG2)",
