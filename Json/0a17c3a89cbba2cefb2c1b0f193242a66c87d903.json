Previously published structures of soluble, stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spikes have revealed that RBDs exist in either a closed (RBDdown) or an open (RBD-up) conformation that can engage in ACE2 binding (16) (17) (18) . In contrast, we observed that all three RBDs on the 3Q-2P-FL spike trimer were present in the closed conformation in the asymmetric reconstruction; the higher resolution C3 map was consequently used for model building ( Figure 2B and S1C). Overall, the map was well resolved in both S1 and S2 subunits, particularly in the S1 NTD and CTD domains that were less resolved in previously published structures, thereby enabling us to model the full extent of these domains. Notably, the local resolution map calculated using cryoSPARC showed much of the spike trimer at substantially higher resolution than 3.6 \u00c5 ( Figure S1D ). The atomic model contains residues 14-1146 with breaks only in the flexible loop (619-631) and the cleavage site (678-688) ( Figure 2C ). Interestingly, superimposition of the coordinate models of 3Q-2P-FL spike with published spike structures (PDB Id: 6VXX and 6VSB) revealed substantial domain rearrangements in the S1 subunit of 3Q-2P-FL spike compared to the other models, whereas the structure of the S2 subunit was consistent with the published data ( Figure 2D ). The S1 NTD differed the most (~14\u00b0 rotation counterclockwise relative to published models when viewing down towards the viral membrane) while the CTD and subdomains showed minor local rearrangements ( Figure 2D) . Notably, we also observed shifts in the placement of residues flanking the 615-635 loop compared to the published models. This region was modeled in one of the published structures (PDB Id: 6X6P) as a helix with residues flanking the helix positioned very differently from our model as shown by the corresponding placement of residues T632 and T618 (residues flanking the gap in 3Q-2P-FL model) ( Figure 3A ). However, upon closer inspection of the cryo-EM density (EMD-22078) corresponding to residues 621-640 of the PDB model 6X6P, there is insufficient density to support the helix conformation of this region ( Figure S1E ). The resulting displacement of residues in the 3Q-2P-FL structure enables inter-protomeric interactions by creating a salt-bridge between residues Asp 614 and Lys 854 ( Figure 3B ).

The first density was buried within a hydrophobic pocket of the CTD created by F338, F342, Y365, Y369, F374, F377, F392, F513 ( Figure 3C and S2B). We had previously observed a non-protein density situated in the structure of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) that was identified to be palmitoleic acid (21) . This pocket in SARS-CoV-2 CTD corresponded with the structure of linoleic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid; the presence of this ligand was confirmed by mass spectrometry of 3Q-2P-FL spike ( Figure S2B and S2C). The main chain carboxyl group of linoleic acid interacts with R408 and Q409 residues of RBD from the adjacent protomer thereby making interprotomer contacts ( Figure 3C ). The second unassigned density present in NTD was relatively larger and more surface exposed than the first density, surrounded by residues N121, Y170, S172, F175, R190, H207, V227 ( Figure 3D and S2D). Analysis of the structural features of this density suggested that it may correspond to PS 80 detergent used to solubilize the membrane-bound trimers and stabilize them in solution. The aliphatic tail of PS 80 fit well into the hydrophobic pocket while the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups were well placed in proximity to residues R190 and H207 with potential for multiple hydrogen bonds between them ( Figure 3D and S2D).

In both reconstructions, the interaction between each pair of trimers involved the SD2 of one protomer from each trimer engaging with the NTD of the adjacent trimer ( Figure 4C ). Consequently, each trimer pair is symmetrical along a 2-fold axis with trimer axes tilted to 44.5 degrees relative to each other. The atomic model of the dimer-of-trimer EM density revealed that the interaction was mainly coordinated by the 615-635 loop. Although most of the loop residues were too flexible to resolve in the free trimer density map, the inter-trimer interaction stabilized the loop so that it could be fully resolved ( Figure 4D ). The loop reaches into a pocket on the adjacent NTD, interacting with residues 621-PVAIHADQ-628 in the loop with NTD residues Q183, H146, Y248, L249, V70 and S71 ( Figure 4D ). We observed subtle changes in the NTD binding pocket in the loop-bound state compared to the free trimer model that allow better accommodation of the loop in the pocket. The residues Y145 and H146 in the binding pocket appear to switch positions in the loop-bound state resulting in a salt bridge interaction between H146 and D627 and potential stacking between W152 and H146 ( Figure 4E ).

Parts of the glycans are stabilized and visible in the dimer-of-trimers map. Due to the close proximity, these glycans might form hydrogen bonds with the symmetry related chain but it is unclear if these glycan interactions aid in the stability of the dimer-of-trimers. To investigate if the residues involved in trimer-trimer interactions are conserved across CoV strains belonging to lineage B of betacoronaviruses, we performed sequence alignment of residues in the loop and corresponding NTD binding pocket across representative strains (Figure S3C). While the loop residues 621-PVAIHADQ-628 are well conserved across strains, we observed varying levels of conservation in the binding pocket with SARS-CoV exhibited the most variability. SARS-CoV-2 has 7 additional residues at position 70-76 (including V70 and S71), 4 additional residues at position at 150-153 and 6 additional residues at 247-252 (including Y248 and L249) compared to SARS-CoV. These insertions along with the absence of H146 at the corresponding site on SARS-CoV make it unlikely for SARS-CoV to participate in these inter-trimeric interactions seen in SARS-CoV-2. While the residues in the NTD pocket were almost identical between SARS-CoV-2 and its closely related bat strain Bat-SL-RatG13, we observed some residue differences and 1-3 amino acid deletions in the loops pangolin/Guandong/1/2019 and BetaCoV/pangolin/Guangxi/P4L/2007 that could potentially impact binding to the loop (Figure S3C). Due to the proximity of this binding pocket to the putative glycan binding site, we conducted structural comparisons of the NTD dimerization pocket with that of the sialic acid (SA) binding site on MERS spike (PDB ID: 6Q04) (15). Comparison to MERS showed that although the SA-binding pocket was in close proximity, it did not coincide with the dimerization pocket on NTD (Figure S3D). While it has not been identified if SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to glycans in a similar manner, computational and structural studies have proposed residues on SARS-CoV-2 spike involved in SA binding (22, 23). Structural comparison of this putative glycan binding site to the dimerization site revealed them situated adjacent to one another with residues in loop 70 contributing to both the binding pockets (Figure S3E). To evaluate if the multimerization phenomenon observed in the full-length spike construct played a role in virus replication, we performed pseudovirus replication assays with SARS-CoV-2 wild-type (WT) spike and two mutant spikes. In mutant 1, the loop residues 621-PVAIHADQ-628 were replaced with a glycine-serine linker to completely knockout binding to NTD and in mutant 2, residues 619-EVPV-622 of SARS-CoV-2 were reverted to residues 619-DVST-622 of SARS-CoV-1. Pseudoviruses containing either WT or mutant spikes were generated in HEK293T cells and used to infect HeLa or HeLa-ACE2 cells. While the WT and mutant 2 exhibited similar levels of infection, we observed no detectable levels of infection for mutant 1 in which all contact residues on the loop", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": "3Q-2P full-length immunogen formulated in polysorbate 80 detergent. Our results show that PS 80 forms detergent micelles around the transmembrane domains of 1 or more spike proteins, enabling the formation of nanoparticle-like rosettes. These larger nanoparticles provide multivalent display of the spike immunogen with potential for better immunogen trafficking and B-cell activation as has been previously shown for nanoparticle-based immunogens (28-30). Consistent with this observation, analysis of safety and immunogenicity of the Novavax SARS-CoV-2-3Q-2P-FL immunogen in mice and baboons revealed strong B-and T-cell responses to the vaccine with no evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) (31).Structural analysis of the 3Q-2P full-length spike immunogen revealed several important findings. The first being the stabilization and shift of the S1 subunit compared to published structures(17,18). Although the cause of this shift is unclear, the presence of PS 80 wedged in the NTD potentially may stabilize the alternate conformation. Notably, another recent study observed differences in their NTD conformations as a function of pH(32). We also observed intertrimer interactions between SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike proteins for the first time. The 615-635 loop that is generally disordered in free trimers, engages the NTD of the adjacent trimer in a well-ordered conformation. The binding pocket on NTD is present adjacent to the putative glycan binding site and shows subtle differences in the apo and loop-bound conformations. The slight displacement of loop residues 68-75 and the reversed positions of Y145 and H146 in the bound state not only allow better accommodation of the loop in the pocket, but also enable the formation of salt bridge interactions between H146 and D627. Importantly, both these findings were seen in the full-length spike immunogen assembled into compact and dense nanoparticles, which may play a role in both the observed S1 shift as well as formation of higher order spike multimers. Cryo-electron tomographic reconstructions of intact SARS-CoV-2 virions showed a relatively dispersed distribution of spike protein trimers on the viral surface and no evidence of higher order aggregates(33). However, another study has shown that the D614G mutation present in close proximity to the dimerization loop results in a several fold increase of spike numbers on the viral surface, resulting in higher spike protein density and a more infectious virion(20). The greater density may be aided by the ability to form such higher order multimers and may also serve to block access to epitopes on the more conserved S2 component of the spike, thereby facilitating immune evasion. Alternatively, loop that mediates inter-spike interactions may play a role in viral viability, consistent with our data showing that replacement of the loop with a GS linker completely abrogated viral infectivity.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": "Toelzer et al. also saw a preference for their structure with linoleic acid to be in the 'down'state (34).

They showed that introducing a disulphide bond between RBD and S2 at positions S383 and D985 stabilized the spike in an all RBD-down conformation while introducing other mutations in SD1 and S2 could alter the number of RBDs present in the 'up' conformation (36).

Samples were separated at a flow rate of 300 nL/min on a nLC 1200 (Thermo). Solutions A and B were 0.1% formic acid in 5% and 80% acetonitrile, respectively. A gradient of 1-25% B over 160 min, an increase to 40% B over 40 min, an increase to 90% B over another 10 min and held at 90% B for 30 min was used for a 240 min total run time. Column was re-equilibrated with solution A prior to the injection of sample. Peptides were eluted directly from the tip of the column and nanosprayed directly into the mass spectrometer by application of 2.8 kV voltage at the back of the column.
