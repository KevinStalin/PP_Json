This reflects delayed cardiac repolarization which is a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD). Despite that in an observational study involving patients with COVID-19 admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine use was not associated with mortality, 5 recent clinical trials that started treating COVID-19 patients with [hydroxy]chloroquine were halted due to increased risk of arrhythmia and mortality. 6 In a recent randomized, controlled, open-label platform trial, in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, researchers randomly assigned 1561 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine and 3155 to receive usual care. The results of this study suggest that the mortality rate among patients in the hydroxychloroquine group was not lower than those who received usual care. 7 Longitudinal studies to assess the electrocardiographic and cardiotoxic effects of [hydroxy]chloroquine are limited. Given that the risk of SCD associated with [hydroxy]chloroquine has never been studied on a population-based scale and because the value of these drugs against COVID-19 infections is still inconclusive, we investigated the association between [hydroxyl]chloroquine and QTcinterval duration and SCD in a population-based prospective cohort study.",

Similarly, there was a significantly increased risk of SCD in current users but not in past users. Although the majority of participants used [hydroxy]chloroquine because of rheumatoid arthritis-a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease 20 [hydroxyl]chloroquine played at least a modifying role. A clinically relevant QTc-interval prolongation, a well-known risk factor for SCD, was observed in almost 9% of ECGs recorded in patients currently treated with [hydroxy]chloroquine. Also, several case-reports of cardiomyopathy attributed to [hydroxyl]chloroquine itself have been published. [21] [22] [23] So far, [hydroxy]chloroquine has been given to thousands of individuals to prevent or treat the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, although the efficacy is controversial. In an animal study, both in vitro and SARS-CoV-2-infected animals, evaluating the antiviral activity of hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin compared with the placebo, no significant difference was shown on viral load levels. 24 Moreover, this study revealed no preventive effect of [hydroxy]chloroquine, possibly because [hydroxy]chloroquine targets a pathway that is not operative in lung cells. 25 According to the FDA's most updated review comments, hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are potential causes of cardiac toxicities, including QTc prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, torsade de Pointes (TdP), and conduction disorders.",

A second limitation is that we did not have data on the indication for use in the currently exposed cases of SCD.
