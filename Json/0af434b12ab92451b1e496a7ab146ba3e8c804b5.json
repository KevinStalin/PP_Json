In the current COVID-19 global pandemic, there is a lack of reliable clinical tools to assist clinicians to perform accurate triage. Host response biomarkers have recently shown promise in risk stratification of disease progression; however, the role of these biomarkers in predicting disease progression in patients with COVID-19 is unknown. Here, we present a protocol outlining a prospective validation study to evaluate the biomarkers' performance in predicting clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. Methods and analysis This prospective validation study assesses patients infected with COVID-19, in whom blood samples are prospectively collected. Recruited patients include a range of infection severity from asymptomatic to critically ill patients, recruited from the community, outpatient clinics, emergency departments and hospitals. Study samples consist of peripheral blood samples collected into RNA-preserving (PAXgene/Tempus) tubes on patient presentation or immediately on study enrolment. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) will be performed on total RNA extracted from collected blood samples using primers specific to host response gene expression biomarkers that have been previously identified in studies of respiratory viral infections. The RT-PCR data will be analysed to assess the diagnostic performance of individual biomarkers in predicting COVID-19-related outcomes, such as viral pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome or bacterial pneumonia. Biomarker performance will be evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Ethics and dissemination This research protocol aims to study the host response gene expression biomarkers in severe respiratory viral infections with a pandemic potential (COVID-19). It has been approved by the local",

There is currently a lack of clinical tools to address these questions, especially in the early phase of COVID-19 illness when symptoms are often very non-specific (eg, fever, cough, anosmia), and thus not informative. Furthermore, initial symptoms may correlate poorly with clinical trajectory (eg, recovery vs deterioration). Other clinical observations such as radiographic evidence (eg, chest CT/ CT) suggestive of pneumonia or signs of hypoxaemia (eg, cyanosis, desaturation) are helpful. However, those are often late signs of impending respiratory failure. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new biomarkers to help identify high-risk patients with COVID-19 in the early stage of the disease.",

These biomarkers fall mainly into three broad categories: (1) routine laboratory parameters (eg, D-dimers, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), lymphopenia), 1 2 (2) inflammatory biomarkers (eg, interleukin 6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP)), 3 4 and (3) research-only immune assays (eg, surface markers on CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes). 5 However, there are major limitations to the use of these biomarkers for risk stratification. First, they are not specific to viral illness. For example, CRP, D-dimers or IL-6 can be elevated in many non-viral conditions, such as trauma, thromboembolism and sepsis. Second, these biomarkers do not correlate well with the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, the key driver of progression in viral pneumonia. Therefore, there is a need to develop and validate biomarkers that (1) are specific to viral pneumonia, and (2) predict the risk of COVID-19 complications, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).",

We will assign an appropriate harm to benefit ratio to determine an optimal decision threshold for clinicians.
