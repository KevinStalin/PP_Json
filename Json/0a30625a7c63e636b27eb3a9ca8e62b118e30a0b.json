Within the NewYork-Presbyterian (NYP) system, the Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, and Allen Hospital -all located in northern Manhattan -offer a combined volume of over 1200 beds. 1 As the pandemic spread and number of COVID-19 cases in New York City rose, resources were centered on the care of COVID-19 patients and all elective inpatient and outpatient procedures were suspended and non-urgent ambulatory visits were canceled. 2 In the weeks following, the pandemic exerted significant strain on the obstetric service with several patients under investigation presenting for evaluation each day, and numerous providers and staff exposed by asymptomatic patients before universal testing was initiated March 22 nd . [3] [4] [5] By the end of March, several full-time obstetric faculty were infected with COVID-19 and staff absenteeism was on the rise, leading to significant gaps in our provider workforce. As March 2020 came to an end, Columbia University's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology (the Department) found its obstetric service not only strained by a constant flow of patients and anxiety among personnel concerned about the risk of COVID-19 exposure, but also with a significant portion of its non-obstetric clinical activity restricted and those staff idle. Simultaneous to this, the number of patients with COVID-19 in New York City had increased exponentially, and the healthcare system across the city quickly exceeded available resources.",

Communication was delivered to all employees by email clearly articulating the expectation that all underutilized faculty and staff would be considered eligible for redeployment within their own campus or at another affiliated institution unless health or other valid reasons prevented this from occurring. Facing both -Redeployment -Page 2 -internal challenges and the risk of external redeployment, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology formed a Redeployment Committee to address departmental needs and utilization of its providers and staff during the escalating pandemic. The goal was to redeploy faculty and staff from relatively inactive areas to critical services, thereby fully utilizing individuals within the Department without unnecessarily pulling resources from the larger institution.",

In addition to ensuring the continued availability of critical clinical services (i.e., prenatal clinics, OB/GYN ultrasound, inpatient obstetrics, gynecologic cancer care and inpatient gynecologic emergencies), there were a number of services necessitated by the COVID-pandemic that needed to be launched almost immediately and that would need to remain operational for the foreseeable future. Examples of these COVID-related activities included: infection and risk of deterioration of their clinical condition, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were initially deemed to be candidates for outpatient management were followed with serial telehealth visits at ~ 48 h intervals for at least 14 days after diagnosis. 6 Given the necessity of timely follow up, this clinic was held 7 days per week with daily volume varying between ~ 5 and 20 patients depending on the number of recently-diagnosed COVID-positive patients at the time.",

In addition, the service itself was strained by an increased volume of patients as all pregnant women were redirected from the main Emergency Department to the triage unit of Labor and Delivery regardless of the nature of their presenting complaint. In addition, there was a need to ensure efficient throughput of patients with COVID symptoms in order to minimize exposure of patients and staff alike, as well as a need to establish an obstetric intensive care unit to provide increased level of care to critically ill pregnant patients unable to be transferred to intensive care units already filled to capacity. Given these challenges, there was a need to increase the depth of coverage of the inpatient obstetric service in order to both meet the clinical demands of the service and provide relief to the already strained providers. \uf0b7 COVID-19 Research: Our Department quickly recognized the need to initiate COVID-related research to inform both local and national care.

Anticipating staff anxiety regarding the potential of redeployment to an unfamiliar area, reassurance was given that the goal was to reassign underutilized personnel to internal roles in order to reduce the likelihood of being redeployed elsewhere across the institution where there would be less control over assignments and where there might be challenges in bringing them back to the Department if / when internal needs arose. Furthermore, the Department was reassured that the expectation was that internal or external redeployment would be within the skill set of the redeployed individual whenever possible, and that necessary training would be given to those redeployed to unfamiliar settings. However, anticipating reluctance, departmental personnel were reminded that redeployment could be mandated for all eligible employees, and those refusing either internal or external redeployment in the absence of qualifying exclusion would potentially be subject to pay reduction or other consequences per University guidance.",

Not surprisingly, when redeployed staff were allowed to sign-up for their inpatient shifts, night and weekend shifts were less popular and harder to fill than weekday daytimes. Given the need for 24/7 coverage including evenings, nights and weekends and since additional pay was not possible, an incentive model was developed to encourage staff to volunteer for less popular shifts. Specifically, staff working less popular shifts earned hours of credit which could be utilized for time off in the current pay period or in the future (i.e. if an individual worked an 8-hour night shift, they would be credited for 12 hours of work affording them 4 hours off in the future). In addition, in an effort to ease the strain of working in a new location and different shift, the Department provided car service for all redeployed employees who had a shift beginning or ending overnight, and also reimbursed up to $20 per day for transportation fees.

Interestingly, those with personal experience caring for a newborn appeared to be more comfortable and experienced an easier transition to the inpatient support role presumably due to their experience as a parent or primary caregiver themselves. Unfortunately, however, there were others who struggled with redeployment in this capacity as evidenced by high call-out rates for their scheduled shifts and failure to engage in the role as it had been defined. Specifically, weekly daytimes were staffed by two General OB attending physicians and two Maternal Fetal Medicine attendings, whereas as nights and weekends were staffed by one attending from each Division in house and another from each Division on backup call from home, available to come in if necessitated by volume and / or acuity.

In addition to maintaining coverage of the inpatient Gynecologic and Gynecologic Oncology services which saw ongoing -albeit reduced -medical and surgical admissions, some outpatient activities were also necessary both in the subspecialties and in general OB Gyn to care for patients with new diagnoses and urgent complaints. Furthermore, because a significant portion of the gynecologic physicians considered for redeployment within the Department were subspecialty fellows, it was necessary to ensure their availability for clinical activity within their subspecialty in order to preserve their education as much as possible. In an effort to ensure coverage of the primary clinical activities of redeployed providers and to prioritize the education of subspecialty fellows, Gynecologic providers were each assigned to no more than 24 hours of obstetric coverage per week. In addition, in order to accommodate fluxes in the clinical activity of the Gynecologic services, the schedule for inpatient obstetric coverage was made on a weekly basis after soliciting availability from each of the faculty and fellows eligible for internal redeployment. By allowing redeployed providers to maintain clinical activity on their primary service and to have input into the timing of the obstetric shifts, a high-degree of engagement was maintained among redeployed providers.",

            "text": "The global COVID-19 pandemic presented our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology with the challenge of simultaneously curtailing non-essential outpatient practice while reinforcing critical inpatient services. By performing a comprehensive assessment of needs and resources within the Department, a newly-formed Redeployment Committee was able to identify underutilized providers and staff and reassign them where necessary. Ultimately, internal needs within the Department required utilization of all individuals available for redeployment and -while internal resources were sufficient to meet demands and external resources were not -Redeployment -Page 11 -necessary -the Department also was unable to contribute staff or providers to broader institutional redeployment initiatives. As the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic began to flatten and emergency restrictions on outpatient and non-essential surgeries were lifted, the Redeployment Committee was tasked with operationalizing the recovery phase and returning redeployed providers and staff to their primary clinical services. Lessons learned from this response to the initial COVID-19 surge can help guide the Department should it face recurrent wave of or another pandemic in the future.",

Individuals with previous direct patient care or in-hospital experience were selected for this in-patient support role given their anticipated comfort in a clinical environment and prior credentialing / clearance necessary to work in the hospital setting. Given the need to provide support of the inpatient obstetric service 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, over 40 individuals were redeployed in this capacity. A Redeployment Guidance document was prepared and distributed including details on reporting requirements, attire, unit locations and access, job description and expectations, use of PPE Personal Protective Equipment, reminders regarding hand hygiene. Staff redeployed to this inpatient role received one shift of orientation shadowing on the unit to become familiar with the environment and activities. -Redeployment -Page 6 -\uf0b7 Pre-admission Testing Clinic (PAT) and COVID-Positive Telehealth Follow-up Clinic: Given the parallels to",

Given the gaps in coverage created by provider illness early in the pandemic and the anticipation of additional outages as the pandemic evolved, it was readily apparent that the inpatient obstetric workforce required reinforcement. Accordingly, within the first week of the pandemic, efforts were undertaken to obtain inpatient obstetric privileges for physicians within the Gynecology service who had previously completed an Obstetrics and Gynecology residency.
