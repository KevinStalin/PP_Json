We designed and delivered \"4Ds for Dealing with Distress\" during the crisis to address this need. 4Ds unifies a spectrum of familiar emotion regulation strategies, resilience exercises, and problem-solving approaches using perceptual control theory and distils them into a simple four-component rubric (Distract-Dilute-Develop-Discover). In essence, the aim is to reduce distress and restore wellbeing, both in the present moment through current actions (distract or dilute), and through expressing longer-term goal conflicts (e.g., through talking, writing, and drawing) to discover new perspectives that arise spontaneously after sufficient time and consideration. The intervention is user-led in that it draws on users' own idiosyncratic and pre-existing experiences, knowledge, skills and resources to help them apply an approach, or combination of approaches, that are proportionate and timed to the nature and context of the stress they are experiencing. In this article we review the empirical basis of the approach within experimental, social, biological and clinical psychology, illustrate the novel and time-efficient delivery format, describe its relevance to sports and exercise, summarise feedback from the recipients of the intervention to date, and describe the directions for future evaluation.",

The intervention was fairly intensive, involving four modules over 2 weeks, and including between-session homework exercises and stress logs.

We have devised an approach of this kind, termed \"The 4Ds of Dealing with Distress.\" In order to do so, we reviewed the research evidence regarding the components of existing interventions to identify which classes of strategies appear to be effective in reducing distress both in the short and long term. We then produced an integrative framework for these components united by a single theoretical framework -perceptual control theory (PCT) -although the theory is not explicitly \"taught\" in the session. In the current article we draw out the particular relevance for our intervention to the psychology of human performance, exercise, sports and the wellbeing of clients and staff within sports organizations.",

            "text": "According to PCT, control is at the heart of adaptive functioning, and so control is the essence of health, wellbeing and mental health (Powers et al., 1960; Carey et al., 2014; Carey, 2016) . Within PCT, distress is the loss of control that emerges when a person cannot achieve and maintain the experiences that are most important to them. There is substantial evidence from experimental research to support such a claim (see Table 1 , Control). In relation to this core tenet of PCT, the third reason for utilizing PCT is that several sources of evidence point to the benefits of acknowledging and embracing client control, choice and user-tailored interventions. It is well established that individuals vary widely in their readiness and pace of change (Hayes et al., 2007) . There is also evidence that having control over stressful experiences, such as facing a fear, is beneficial (Healey et al., 2017) . When users are interviewed about how they utilized existing interventions, they commonly report selecting and personalizing the strategies and insights that they find relevant to their own specific situation (Amos et al., 2019; Warwick et al., 2019) . Building on these features, when clients are given the control to book their own timing and duration of appointments, the benefits include a reduced waiting list (Carey and Spratt, 2009 ) and a greater efficiency of the intervention relative to benchmarked studies (Carey et al., 2013) . A previously developed group intervention based on PCT -known as the Take Control Course (TCC) -has an emerging evidence base (Morris et al., 2016) . This supports the principles of a psychological intervention based on PCT; however, unlike 4Ds, the TCC is six weekly sessions, provides more in-depth explanation of theoretical principles, and was initially designed for people within mental health services to access in person rather than online.",

            "text": "to act in a way that restores control over these experiences will relieve distress in the short term -we have termed these \"distraction\" and \"dilution.\" Examples of distraction are hobbies and other pleasurable activities, as well as internal processes such as daydreaming. Distraction is a commonly used term to describe common, everyday activities that intentionally shift attention away from one's problematic thoughts and feelings for a period of time and may even improve mood (see Table 1 ). Some of these activities, such as sport, exercise, and nature engagement, whilst being \"distracting, \" may tap into other more significant pathways to well-being that overlap with the later components of 4Ds, such as providing opportunities to safely reflect on problems, or to become aware of higher level values, such as health during exercise and connectedness with others during team sports (Hoye et al., 2012) . We save the term \"dilution\" for those novel, specialist-trained activities that aim to reduce heightened states of distress in the moment, and they include mindfulness training, slow breathing techniques, grounding methods, and applied relaxation. Both distraction and dilution may restore control very effectively in the short term but at the same time not resolve long-term issues, or even have the potential for generating other problems. For example, distracting oneself with taking on extra work can help a person feel that they are meeting their standards for productivity, but failing to meet their standards for spending time with the family. There is even evidence that inflexible engagement with sports or exercise have \"addictive\" properties (Bamber et al., 2000; Nogueira et al., 2018) . Engaging in mindfulness mediation for 45 min every day may provide a sense of control over negative thoughts as one decenters from them, but take one's attention away from thoughts about pressing issues (paying fines, housing repairs, and dealing with threats to employment) that need to be addressed as soon as possible. Thus, the PCT approach encourages each individual to work out the most adaptive and flexible use of any approach rather than providing any blanket advice about specific strategies. There is considerable evidence from systematic reviews that psychological flexibility is closely associated with mental health and wellbeing (Kashdan and Rottenberg, 2010; , and a PCT approach to the use of behavioral or cognitive strategies proposes that clients are provided with the opportunity to weigh up the pros and cons of these as applied to their own life context (Alsawy et al., 2014) .",

There are a variety of examples of goal conflict occuring in the context of sports and exercise (Graham and Dixon, 2017) . For example, an experimental study of students who had the goal of exercising found that priming the conflicting goal of performing well academically led to evidence of reduced motivation to engage in physical exercise (Bailis et al., 2011) . The range of potential goal conflicts are highly idiosyncratic. For example, a manager of a gym may want to maintain their sense as a trustworthy person by re-employing all of her staff after lockdown, but at the same time want to keep her family financially secure through streamlining staffing at the organization. Taking another example, an employee experiencing bullying from a colleague may be in conflict between seeking help to stop the bullying, and keeping the experience private for fear of being ridiculed or experiencing further retaliation.",

Because the process of change is spontaneoussometimes getting worse before it gets better -it can feel destabilizing in itself. The individual therefore needs to be in control of the discovery process, even if it requires the help of another person such as a curious listener. It is this further userled element of the 4Ds that is termed \"develop\" and prompts the user to plan and prepare the most suitable conditions to set forth into, the sometimes open-ended, discovery process.",

In fact, the aim of 4Ds is to enable each user to integrate the methods they have already encountered and started to use, rather than to train intensively in any new techniques. For many users who have experienced training in all kinds of well-being techniques to date, this user-led emphasis can be refreshing, or even pivotal in their appreciation of the 4Ds approach. 4Ds is focused on explaining how and why wellbeing approaches may work so that the individual can find their own, unique combination of solutions.",

For example, clients with a health or exercise background are reminded of how they might deal with the physical pain from an injury. In the very short term -distraction may help -for example for a football player to get through a match by focusing on the game if they can manage it. Typically though, some form of dilution is also necessary -an analgesic to reduce the pain, for example. Yet, we are all aware that a significant injury will require more active exploration. The person with the injury will plan to consult a physiotherapist, or a doctor, who will do various tests and potentially scans, to attempt to discover which parts of the body are injured, as this will inform the appropriate intervention. Thus, there is a stage that involves development of a plan to make the appointment and preparing what to say to the health professional, and there is a stage that involves the actual exploration to discover the nature of the problem. The \"catch\" for problems with emotional distress is that only the person experiencing the distress can fully explore what is behind it. Only the symptoms, but not the source, can be identified by an expert on the outside with a test or a scan. A person experiencing distress is like a car looking under its own bonnet to work out what part is not working right.",

Their aim is to temporarily remove the experience of distress and clients often share forms of exercise and sporting activities as sources of distraction. Many of these activities also potentially serve important personal goals for the individual, thereby indirectly improving mood. For some people with some problems, distraction can be sufficient to redirect them away from their distress, so that they can find a way round the problems without extensively and intentionally exploring them. For example, during lockdown, one personal trainer lost her job at an indoor gym. She felt undervalued, sad and angry with her employer. One day she chose to distract herself from their feelings by running regularly with a local running club. At the club she met the manager of a personal trainer agency who offered her a well-paid role, which resolved her job stress in the short term. However, under different circumstances, distraction may purely allow the individual to mentally disengage from the stress for a brief period, offering only short-term relief and not tapping into the source of distress. In this case, users are encouraged to move up the pyramid to the second component.",

These techniques overlap with various techniques used in a variety of other approaches, but in 4Ds they are aligned under one principle; they provide the client with greater control at that moment. This may be control over physiological experiences (slow breathing and muscle tension), or thinking (mindful awareness and grounding techniques). Thus, the client gets a sense of control in the moment, and these techniques interfere with the actions that can perpetuate their current, most distressing states of mind.",

Therefore, the concept of \"worry time\" is introduced -a specific time of the day or evening to think about their problems. They are also reminded to think of a time in their life that they were able to cope, to draw upon some of the same strengths and resources.

The clients are then encouraged to do the \"upward arrow\" approach, adopted from the Take Control Course . This is a succession of \"What makes that important?\" questions help them to become aware of the higher level goals, values, ideals, and principles that are challenged by their difficulties. They are also provided with an opportunity to use expressive writing and reflect on the experience of doing so (Pennebaker and Chung, 2011) , and they are introduced to Discovery Talk (@DiscoveryTalk), a way of adapting Method of Levels therapy (Carey, 2006) for people who are not mental health professionals to use in their everyday settings. In doing so, they are directed toward simple ways of actively listening to one another to help explore a problem, without giving advice, interpretations, or solutions, and helped to notice the new perspectives that they gain from the experience (Churchman et al., 2019) .",

Feedback suggests a reduction in immediate stress symptoms, increased awareness around the cause of stress, improved confidence in managing stress and a preference for the \"develop\" and \"discover\" components.

Additionally, the clients seem to appreciate that the approach is universal, in keeping with the universal principles of PCT, with clients expressing a keenness to try these with others too. For example, teachers spoke of the strategies being useful for their own stress but were also enthused to try them with pupils; indicative of the model being applicable to most ages and sources of stress. To date, suggestions for improvement typically involve the request for more opportunities to learn ways to engage in discovery, such a extended opportunities for expressive writing, or more training in the kinds of questions to ask to help another person explore their problems in more depth and detail. In response to this, we have included a followup session for some groups to extend the practice and to receive feedback on this last section of the course as well as referring them to wider resources such as online journaling and expressive writing resources, @DiscoveryTalk and videos of Method of Levels in action.",

Unlike alternative interventions, it entrusts clients with their own selection, use and testing of various strategies to meet the idiosyncratic and varying stressors in their own life. It builds upon techniques and principles that the clients will be familiar with but integrates them within one simple rubric and puts them in charge of how and when to use each approach. Whilst the science of the intervention is empirically supported, it requires systematic evaluation of its impact within this format, and of its putative mechanisms of action. Nonetheless, quantitative and qualitative audits have indicated that many clients grasp the key messages and report benefits. Given the challenging times we are in, it is imperative that practitioners and researchers work on the most efficient means to address stress and improve wellbeing, but in ways that enable expression and collective action rather than minimize and isolate suffering. The 4Ds is designed in such a way within its focus on fostering the agency of the individual to construct their own solutions, which may ultimately manifest at the individual, organizational, and societal levels.",
